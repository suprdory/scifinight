21/09/2016, 09:17 - You created this group
21/09/2016, 09:18 - Nathan: https://goo.gl/images/cW6Un8
21/09/2016, 09:18 - Nathan: It works!
21/09/2016, 09:44 - Olly: I suspected so, although conserving energy and not violating entropy laws would give the universe a head ache I imagine
21/09/2016, 09:57 - Nathan: Yes, that sounds harder to sort out. But temporo-topologically  it seems sound.
21/09/2016, 09:59 - Nathan: I think the energy would be fairly easy to sort out but reckon it's just straight up incompatible with entropy as we know it.
21/09/2016, 10:01 - Nathan: For a start entropy implies a direction to time, which means a temporal sequence has a beginning, which the loop in the film cannot have.
21/09/2016, 10:01 - Nathan: I think that's what Luke was angry at?
21/09/2016, 10:05 - Olly: You can always decrease entropy in one place, if you increase it enough somewhere else. Maybe that's what the explosions are for
21/09/2016, 11:43 - Luke: Still makes no sense in terms of Jane's birth and if anyone says chicken and egg I'll start boycotting sci-fi night
21/09/2016, 15:07 - Nathan: It's a closed loop, it's fine.
21/09/2016, 15:16 - John Begley: It's a classic rooster situation
21/09/2016, 15:19 - Luke: Can't tell if you're trying to wind me up or believe it. Which just winds me up more!
21/09/2016, 15:35 - James A: I'd say it was one of the more coherent films we've watched
21/09/2016, 15:37 - John Begley: He just doesn't understand the 'hermaphrodites that just pop into existence' principle.  Its fairly standard.
21/09/2016, 16:45 - Luke: I'm sad to admit that a movie created purely to get the story of someone being their mother, father and daughter on film is still one of the most coherent ones we've watched!
21/09/2016, 16:47 - Nathan: And son.
21/09/2016, 17:01 - Luke: Sorry, good point
27/09/2016, 08:43 - Nathan: Sci-fi tonight?
27/09/2016, 08:44 - John Begley: Yep
27/09/2016, 08:49 - Luke: Got work and then some meeting I agreed to go to :(
27/09/2016, 08:50 - James A: Innit
27/09/2016, 14:11 - Olly: Yep
27/09/2016, 14:15 - Olly: Luke: are you causing trouble in the camelot building?
27/09/2016, 14:31 - Luke: Ha ha, nah but kind of jokes action, squatting the anti-squat companies building :)
27/09/2016, 15:13 - Nathan: Sorry guys, I'm calling off sci-fi tonight. Tuckk's a bit ill and could do with some peace.
27/09/2016, 15:14 - Nathan: I'm away next week...so next sci-fi night will be 11th Oct
27/09/2016, 15:14 - James A: Ok dude, hope she gets well soon
27/09/2016, 16:30 - Olly: Ok, hope she's better soon
10/10/2016, 21:00 - Nathan: Tuesday or Wednesday?
10/10/2016, 21:02 - Luke: I'm chilled with either this week
10/10/2016, 21:03 - John Begley: I always prefer Tuesday, but I don't mind if it's wednesday
10/10/2016, 21:11 - Luke: Lol just realised Sam isn't in this WhatsApp group. We are obviously never going to pick Wednesday's
10/10/2016, 21:49 - James A: Can't do Wednesday but might be about tomorrow
11/10/2016, 00:07 - Olly: Im at a funeral tomorrow, so probably can't do Tuesday
11/10/2016, 00:23 - Nathan: I count the votes as Tuesday 0, Wednesday -1.
11/10/2016, 09:14 - John Begley: Is it tonight then?
11/10/2016, 09:14 - Nathan: I think so.
11/10/2016, 09:43 - John Begley: What time is it starting? (If it is happening)
11/10/2016, 09:44 - Nathan: Anytime from now.
11/10/2016, 09:54 - John Begley: I will probably get there at 16:35.
11/10/2016, 10:07 - Nathan: Alright. I'll get home for 4.
11/10/2016, 13:31 - Luke: Cool will aim for 4!
11/10/2016, 14:56 - Luke: Actually 4.35 too
11/10/2016, 15:26 - James A: Don't think I'll be out this evening, feeling a bit ill :/
17/10/2016, 07:54 - Nathan: <Media omitted>
17/10/2016, 07:57 - John Begley: Hahaha. It sure does.
17/10/2016, 08:02 - Luke: Ha. Good spot. For like 30 seconds I was like 'why's nathan sent a photo of a normal Morley's, this is awkward'
17/10/2016, 08:29 - James A: Haha! There's a couple of places on Stanstead Road that pay a 'cheeky homage' to South London's favourite. Fantastic Morleys, and 'Monleys'. Spoilt for choice!
17/10/2016, 12:34 - Olly: I'm glad that they've decided to tone down and play it safer than previous slogans. Some might still argue that 'taste' is perhaps too strong a word for their food though
17/10/2016, 12:34 - Olly: Is sci fi on tomorrow?
17/10/2016, 13:26 - John Begley: What do you suggest? Morleys...it exists.
17/10/2016, 13:36 - James A: I'd say that was accurate
17/10/2016, 14:22 - Nathan: Yeah, sci-fi tomorrow.
18/10/2016, 12:33 - Luke: What time?
18/10/2016, 12:38 - Olly: I'll be there 630ish
18/10/2016, 12:51 - Nathan: I'm at home, so whenever.
18/10/2016, 12:51 - Nathan: Actually. I need to do a bit of work still. Anytime after 2.
18/10/2016, 13:02 - John Begley: Can't make it tonight.  I have a stupid team dinner with work.
18/10/2016, 13:02 - John Begley: Cunts
18/10/2016, 13:09 - Nathan: I'm open on Wednesdays too.
18/10/2016, 13:24 - John Begley: Might see you tomorrow then
18/10/2016, 13:30 - Olly: I prob can't do tomorrow
18/10/2016, 13:40 - Nathan: Don't worry, the real sci-fi night is tonight.
18/10/2016, 14:31 - Luke: So is tomorrow "sci-fy night: it watches"
18/10/2016, 15:55 - John Begley: Hahaha!
18/10/2016, 16:42 - James A: Will be over about 6:15
18/10/2016, 20:26 - Nathan: Sexmission. Tits all over the place.
18/10/2016, 20:39 - John Begley: Noooooooooo!
18/10/2016, 20:39 - John Begley: Work meal: zero tits
18/10/2016, 20:39 - John Begley: So far
19/10/2016, 08:44 - Olly: 30psi is 2 atmospheres
19/10/2016, 08:45 - John Begley: Phew.
19/10/2016, 08:46 - Nathan: Then why don't they make car tires from tarpaulin?
25/10/2016, 08:10 - John Begley: Is it on tonight?
25/10/2016, 08:10 - Nathan: Yes.
25/10/2016, 08:11 - John Begley: From 16:00?
25/10/2016, 08:11 - Nathan: Yep
25/10/2016, 08:11 - John Begley: I'll be there at 16:35
25/10/2016, 08:41 - James A: About 18:20 for me
25/10/2016, 09:30 - Luke: Not sure, will try for 4/4.30
25/10/2016, 09:32 - Luke: Though may have some trouble getting to you! http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/camberwell-flooding-road-submerged-under-water-and-50-homes-at-risk-after-water-main-bursts-a3377841.html
25/10/2016, 09:46 - Nathan: lol
25/10/2016, 16:37 - James A: How do the bus routes look now?
25/10/2016, 16:39 - Nathan: Come from elephant if you can.
25/10/2016, 16:39 - James A: Ok cool, cheers
25/10/2016, 17:19 - Olly: Will do
01/11/2016, 10:20 - Nathan: Sci-fi tonight?
01/11/2016, 10:32 - Luke: Yep
01/11/2016, 11:04 - John Begley: Can't tonight. Due to vs family dieing etc I think I need to ramp up the boyfriend support.
01/11/2016, 12:47 - Olly: Can't do tonight. Could do tomorrow evening if you don't do it tonight.
01/11/2016, 12:47 - Olly: (Got to have an argument with landlord instead)
01/11/2016, 12:52 - Nathan: I'm busy tomorrow...
01/11/2016, 12:53 - Nathan: I'll be home from 4 for anyone who wants to come.
01/11/2016, 13:13 - Luke: Cool, will come by round 4.30/5ish
01/11/2016, 21:36 - Nathan: Quintet and shit pizza.
01/11/2016, 22:01 - Olly: Which was worse?
01/11/2016, 22:35 - John Begley: I've already seen quintet
01/11/2016, 22:35 - John Begley: The first bit anyway
02/11/2016, 08:58 - Nathan: If you liked the first bit you'll love the rest.
02/11/2016, 09:07 - Luke: Especially if you liked the fuzzy bits at the edge of the shot
02/11/2016, 09:41 - John Begley: They were my favourite bits!
02/11/2016, 10:04 - Nathan: If anyone is considering watching Quintet as homework I recommend at least x2.5
02/11/2016, 10:04 - John Begley: Hahaha
02/11/2016, 10:05 - John Begley: As you always said, unwatchable.
02/11/2016, 11:05 - Luke: Nathan kept quoting this review that said it was one of the best movies of all time while we were watching it
02/11/2016, 11:30 - John Begley: Haha
02/11/2016, 13:10 - Nathan: http://seedyroad.com/diversions/quintet.htm
02/11/2016, 13:48 - Luke: " Requiring multiple viewings to fully appreciate" - put it back on for next season?
02/11/2016, 13:52 - Luke: However tarkovsky's stalker (the other mentioned classic of that great year in cinematic history) does look like it could be good, and is sci-fi?
02/11/2016, 13:52 - John Begley: Seen it. Not at Sci fi though
02/11/2016, 13:53 - John Begley: Good but definitely a x1.5'er
02/11/2016, 14:18 - Nathan: It's one of the only films where it's faster to read the book.
02/11/2016, 14:22 - Luke: Lol
07/11/2016, 20:21 - Nathan: Sci-fi tomorrow?
07/11/2016, 20:37 - James A: Yep!
07/11/2016, 20:53 - Luke: Yeh, but I won't be there till 19.22
07/11/2016, 21:27 - John Begley: Yep
07/11/2016, 21:40 - Olly: Yes, but I can't stay long as I have an early flight the next day
08/11/2016, 17:31 - Olly: I need a beer, but can only visit briefly tonight. Are people ok for a pub trip til 8 at least, when I need to go?
08/11/2016, 17:33 - Nathan: I'll have a beer. Might need to eat before 8 though.
08/11/2016, 17:34 - Olly: Jamaican pasty
08/11/2016, 17:34 - John Begley: You're a Jamaican pasty
08/11/2016, 17:37 - James A: I'll be there about half six, could do with eating!
08/11/2016, 17:40 - Luke: I'll want food when I arrive at 7.15.
08/11/2016, 17:42 - Olly: Drink beer in pub whilst waiting for the 45 minutes it takes them to cook shit pizza?
08/11/2016, 17:43 - John Begley: I never want shit pizza again
08/11/2016, 17:45 - Luke: Nu shit pizza?
08/11/2016, 17:45 - Luke: I don't want pizza
08/11/2016, 17:45 - Luke: I veto all pizza as my vote
08/11/2016, 17:45 - John Begley: Is that morrisons/oven pizza?
08/11/2016, 17:45 - Nathan: How about shit nando's?
08/11/2016, 17:45 - Luke: Yeh
08/11/2016, 17:46 - Luke: Is shit nandos just Morley's?
08/11/2016, 17:46 - Nathan: Nah, it's grilled chicken from the shit pizza shop
08/11/2016, 17:47 - John Begley: Their beef is rancid, but apparently their chicken is fine
08/11/2016, 17:47 - Luke: Lol.
08/11/2016, 18:27 - John Begley: We're in the pub
08/11/2016, 18:49 - Luke: Fucksd my brakes in central London, don't think I'll make it. Sorry!!
08/11/2016, 18:51 - John Begley: Rubbish. Fair enough.
08/11/2016, 18:51 - Luke: Shit, and the back wheel :'(
08/11/2016, 19:07 - Nathan: 56a?
08/11/2016, 19:23 - Luke: Where?
08/11/2016, 19:59 - Luke: <Media omitted>
08/11/2016, 19:59 - Luke: What film you guys going for?
08/11/2016, 20:00 - Nathan: Looks serious
08/11/2016, 20:01 - Nathan: Dunno about the film. Shnandos for food though.
08/11/2016, 20:10 - Luke: Really?!! James is having Shnandos? How rancid is it?
08/11/2016, 20:27 - James A: Pleasantly unrancid!
08/11/2016, 20:28 - Luke: That's the kind of review we look for in sci-fi night eateries
09/11/2016, 07:36 - John Begley: Brexit 2.0
09/11/2016, 07:37 - Olly: Fuck pants. But worse. For the love of god...
09/11/2016, 07:40 - James A: Beyond satire.
09/11/2016, 08:14 - Nathan: Cook a cat.
14/11/2016, 23:19 - Nathan: Sci-fi?
15/11/2016, 06:20 - Olly: Yes
15/11/2016, 06:21 - Olly: Remind me, I have a film name to add to the list. Exciting
15/11/2016, 06:21 - Luke: Yeh
15/11/2016, 06:22 - Olly: What are you doing up so early?
15/11/2016, 06:31 - Luke: I call it reverse insomnia. I get to sleep fine. But then wake up early and can't get back to sleep.
15/11/2016, 06:48 - John Begley: Yep
15/11/2016, 06:59 - Olly: That sucks Luke. Although if you aren't tired because of it then I guess it's awesome
15/11/2016, 12:05 - John Begley: When does it begin?
15/11/2016, 12:21 - Nathan: I'm at work but can get home anytime...
15/11/2016, 12:33 - John Begley: I will be there at 16.45
15/11/2016, 12:37 - Luke: Prob the same
15/11/2016, 17:59 - Nathan: ETA?
15/11/2016, 18:19 - James A: I'm not going to make it tonight (or next week), have a good one.
15/11/2016, 18:29 - Nathan: Cheers
15/11/2016, 23:35 - Luke: Thank God for x1.3 speed
22/11/2016, 10:38 - Nathan: Sci-fi?
22/11/2016, 10:57 - James A: Yep. Not around next week though. Was the Lobster on the list? Saw that the other day
22/11/2016, 10:57 - Olly: Yea
22/11/2016, 10:58 - Nathan: Lobster still on the list. Am I the only one who hasn't seen it now?
22/11/2016, 11:33 - John Begley: I've seen it. Can't make Sci fi though, so maybe watch it tonight
22/11/2016, 11:35 - Nathan: What about if I'm put Towerfall on the list?
22/11/2016, 11:36 - John Begley: Is that the amazing game?
22/11/2016, 11:37 - Nathan: Yeah. It's quite obviously better than any of those films.
22/11/2016, 11:42 - Luke: Yeh up for tonight! (So prob no lobster, sorry!) What time?
22/11/2016, 11:57 - Nathan: Whenever
22/11/2016, 12:46 - Olly: I've not seen lobster. Could do a bit of tower fall, but a ten minute sci fi film could be good. Like an animatrix episode?
22/11/2016, 18:27 - James A: Getting bus from Oval
27/11/2016, 01:24 - Nathan: <Media omitted>
27/11/2016, 01:24 - Nathan: Is this canonical?
27/11/2016, 07:39 - John Begley: It might be. What does canonical mean?
29/11/2016, 08:29 - Nathan: Sci-fi?
29/11/2016, 08:30 - John Begley: Yep. Probably at 6 though
29/11/2016, 08:30 - Olly: Yes, baring any cycling accidents that might occur
29/11/2016, 08:38 - Luke: Sorry, fighting! Have a good one!
29/11/2016, 08:48 - James A: Corporate team building exercise for me
29/11/2016, 08:49 - John Begley: Are you going paintball?
29/11/2016, 12:43 - John Begley: Can't make it tonight. Victoria has possibly cracked a rib climbing and I need to tend to her.
29/11/2016, 13:11 - Olly: Is there just two left?
29/11/2016, 13:11 - Olly: Beer at Pub?
29/11/2016, 15:17 - Nathan: Yep, ok
06/12/2016, 09:29 - Nathan: Sci-fi? Season finale tonight...
06/12/2016, 09:30 - Olly: Yes
06/12/2016, 09:35 - Luke: Yeh
06/12/2016, 09:48 - James A: Yep
06/12/2016, 10:29 - John Begley: Yep. What time?
06/12/2016, 10:31 - Nathan: You tell me...
06/12/2016, 10:31 - John Begley: 4?
06/12/2016, 10:31 - Nathan: Ok
06/12/2016, 10:33 - Nathan: Also, anyone want to see Stewart Lee tomorrow?
06/12/2016, 10:34 - John Begley: I dislike him
06/12/2016, 10:34 - John Begley: So no
06/12/2016, 11:57 - Olly: I like him. So probably. Where, when, how much?
06/12/2016, 12:00 - Nathan: Leicester square theatre, 7pm, £30.
06/12/2016, 12:33 - Olly: Let's do it. Should I book my own, or are you going to?
06/12/2016, 12:35 - Nathan: I got tickets.
06/12/2016, 12:48 - Olly: Good good. See you 630 tonight
06/12/2016, 15:45 - Nathan: I'm running a bit late. Back about 1615.
06/12/2016, 17:19 - Olly: I can't wait for the worst sci fi film of the season. Maybe, worst even, of the year!
06/12/2016, 17:45 - James A: I'm stuck at work at the mo, will probably be there for just after seven
06/12/2016, 18:27 - Nathan: Food votes?
06/12/2016, 18:35 - Nathan: McD's got 3 votes in the first round.
06/12/2016, 18:36 - James A: Just got off at Oval! I'm up for same
06/12/2016, 18:43 - James A: On the bus, ten mins. Is it the Scottish Restaurant or somewhere else?
06/12/2016, 18:45 - Nathan: We're in McDonald's
06/12/2016, 18:45 - Nathan: What do you want?
06/12/2016, 18:46 - James A: Large quarter pounder with cheese with a coke please! And some BBQ sauce. Ta.
06/12/2016, 18:46 - James A: Sorry meant to say large meal
06/12/2016, 18:47 - Nathan: Ok
06/12/2016, 23:34 - Nathan: No country with a McDonald’s can remain a democracy

https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/06/mcdonalds-democracy-corporate-globalisation-trump-le-pen-farage?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_WhatsApp
06/12/2016, 23:34 - Nathan: Well done guys.
07/12/2016, 07:14 - Olly: And yet we democratically decided upon mcdonalds last night. (Or did we?)
13/12/2016, 09:52 - You added Spam
13/12/2016, 09:53 - Nathan: Warning: Sci-Fi night is tomorrow. Not tonight.
14/12/2016, 13:24 - Luke: What time?
14/12/2016, 13:27 - Nathan: I'm not sure, I'm home but attending a meeting remotely from two.
14/12/2016, 13:31 - John Begley: I'll be late. My boss is leaving. Eat without me but don't start the film choosing process.
14/12/2016, 13:33 - Spam: I'll hopefully be there by 6
14/12/2016, 13:35 - John Begley: A cameo from mackerel
14/12/2016, 13:37 - Luke: Cool just let me know when you want to to start, I'm 10 mins away and not doing anything I can't stop

Yeh when did sam get added?
14/12/2016, 13:38 - James A: Half six for me
14/12/2016, 14:25 - Olly: 630 for me
14/12/2016, 15:57 - Nathan: Half 4?
14/12/2016, 16:07 - Luke: Yeh see you then
14/12/2016, 18:17 - James A: On the bus, are you in pub or flat?
14/12/2016, 18:18 - Nathan: Home
19/12/2016, 10:00 - John Begley: <Media omitted>
19/12/2016, 10:01 - Nathan: Mate
19/12/2016, 10:02 - John Begley: Mate
19/12/2016, 10:03 - John Begley: Needed a car. Bought a car. Bosh. Mate. Absolute ledge. Bosh.
20/12/2016, 15:08 - Olly: John you are suddenly so much more attractive now for some reason.
20/12/2016, 15:11 - Olly: Btw, I've got tomorrow off work for no reason, so can come over earlier if it means finishing the (inevitably dreadful) film earlier. Although I suppose that depends on if other people have got tomorrow off for no reason too
20/12/2016, 15:18 - Nathan: Shame the weather looks shit tomorrow. Was planning an adventure.
20/12/2016, 15:19 - Luke: Thamesmead?
20/12/2016, 15:19 - Nathan: Yeah maybe, but not in the rain
20/12/2016, 15:20 - Olly: John has a car, for this very purpose
20/12/2016, 15:20 - Luke: O yeh rain all day. Fuck that
20/12/2016, 15:21 - Olly: You could drive around thamesmead all day, pumping out that jungle music, impressing the kids
20/12/2016, 15:22 - John Begley: I wish. I'm driving to Norwich to scope it out
20/12/2016, 15:23 - Nathan: I'll save you the trouble: tractors.
21/12/2016, 12:09 - Olly: Anyone interested in coming to see Adam Curtis and others, conversing about false news on evening of tues 7th feb? It's not cheap (£25) but the guy is a legend
21/12/2016, 14:04 - Nathan: Not sure...
21/12/2016, 14:05 - Nathan: But sci-fi night starts in half an hour...
21/12/2016, 14:13 - Olly: I can be there from 330. But I don't have attention span to play games for more than about 30 mins, so would rather arrive approx in time of food/film star. When will everyone be there for?
21/12/2016, 14:24 - Spam: I thought the end of year special marked the end of sci-fi night for this year! I can't make it tonight now
21/12/2016, 14:33 - Nathan: Mack, you're not very good at this...
21/12/2016, 14:41 - Nathan: Tonight is the grand unveiling of the new season's playlist featuring a new analytics system to further aide/complicate voting proceedings.
21/12/2016, 17:48 - John Begley: <Media omitted>
21/12/2016, 17:49 - Nathan: Is that for the car?
21/12/2016, 17:56 - John Begley: thats the back seat
21/12/2016, 17:59 - Nathan: Are you coming?
21/12/2016, 18:31 - John Begley: No. I'm in Norwich. The hotel is sick
21/12/2016, 18:31 - Nathan: For real?
21/12/2016, 18:32 - Nathan: I thought the Norwich thing was a joke?
21/12/2016, 21:17 - John Begley: Haha. Yes
21/12/2016, 22:47 - Nathan: Hector was Mexican?
21/12/2016, 22:50 - Luke: Yeh there was a Felix navidad thing in his house, so he definitely spoke Spanish, assumed mexican.
21/12/2016, 22:50 - Luke: Think there was another clue but can't remember it now
21/12/2016, 22:53 - Luke: Also just realised it was a Xmas film. Or just arbitrarily based at xmas
21/12/2016, 23:03 - Nathan: But consider the against: no sombrero, no nachos, no tequila.
21/12/2016, 23:06 - Luke: Well it was a film full of subtlety
22/12/2016, 22:29 - Luke: Izzy just asked me if we ever watched a film so bad at sci Fi night that we stopped watching it
22/12/2016, 22:30 - Nathan: Officially, no.
22/12/2016, 22:32 - Olly: How was the roof?
22/12/2016, 22:34 - Nathan: Actually got pretty high. Went on AIR at Winter Wonderland.
22/12/2016, 22:35 - Olly: Fail
22/12/2016, 22:37 - Olly: Unless you sneaked in of course?
22/12/2016, 22:40 - Nathan: It's the only Zierer star shape in Britain.
27/12/2016, 20:41 - Nathan: Sci-fi is on tomorrow. Who's coming?
27/12/2016, 20:46 - James A: Not about tomorrow, have a good one
27/12/2016, 20:54 - Luke: In wolves :(
27/12/2016, 21:17 - Olly: In a magical land far away
27/12/2016, 21:17 - Luke: Wolves?
27/12/2016, 21:18 - Olly: There are no wolves left in Bristol
27/12/2016, 21:20 - Olly: John of course lives in Norwich now, so you might be on your own this time?
27/12/2016, 23:12 - John Begley: Haha
27/12/2016, 23:12 - John Begley: It's true
28/12/2016, 12:33 - Spam: Sorry , also away in Stroud

29/12/2016, 15:47 - Luke: Monday works for me!
03/01/2017, 13:16 - Olly: Is there scifi this week?
03/01/2017, 13:40 - Spam: Wednesday?
03/01/2017, 14:27 - Nathan: Probably not. I'm ill.
03/01/2017, 14:28 - John Begley: What illness do you have?
03/01/2017, 14:30 - Olly: Do any non-ill folks fancy seeing star wars at cinema? Surprisingly, I've heard multiple corroborating reports that it is good
03/01/2017, 14:30 - Olly: And it is sci fi
03/01/2017, 14:41 - Luke: Awwww shit. But it is just the cost of urban exploration
03/01/2017, 14:42 - John Begley: Seen it. Your reports are half right. It's OK.
03/01/2017, 14:43 - Luke: The fact it is sci-fi is putting me off to be honest
09/01/2017, 12:31 - Olly: How you feeling Nathan? Short bug or mega flu?
09/01/2017, 12:45 - Nathan: I'm feeling alright apart from a bad case of sci-fi deprivation.
09/01/2017, 13:48 - Olly: Understandable. Were you thinking of Sci fi on Wednesday?
09/01/2017, 14:12 - Nathan: Yes I were.
09/01/2017, 17:23 - Olly: Marvelous

12/01/2017, 13:16 - James A: I need 3, is that ok? Or if you tell me which level you get I'll get same
12/01/2017, 13:31 - Olly: If you need 3, do you fancy buying all? (Including buying mine and Nathan's too?). If you can't - then no worries I can buy all instead.

13/01/2017, 12:16 - Olly: Same Nathan, but it was the special exclusive group for granddaddy watchers.
13/01/2017, 12:16 - Olly: Sounds kind of creepy...
13/01/2017, 13:39 - John Begley: Hahaha
16/01/2017, 19:11 - James A: Alright, is sci-fi on this week? Is it Wednesday?
16/01/2017, 19:11 - Nathan: Yes to both.

18/01/2017, 10:42 - John Begley: I'll be there. Court?
18/01/2017, 10:43 - Spam: Yeah, I've been charged with something but relying on Nathan to persuade the rest of the jury to find me innocent

01/02/2017, 10:11 - John Begley: I can't come.
01/02/2017, 10:17 - Luke: Shit! So many illnesses. I'm not up to anything else tonight so can definitely come if you're feeling up to it!

02/03/2017, 08:01 - Nathan: Anyone up for a cycling holiday this summer? Don't know where or when. Probably for a week to ten days.
02/03/2017, 08:54 - Luke: Yeh!
02/03/2017, 09:36 - Olly: May well be, but I'm not sure about cycling for that many days!
02/03/2017, 09:54 - Spam: I don't think I will have enough holiday left :(
02/03/2017, 18:10 - Olly: I recently realised that I will no longer be able to say I'm in my early 30s in a few days. I can't be arsed to do a celebration, but it is an excuse to go to the pub on Sat evening. Interested?
02/03/2017, 18:22 - James A: Ah I'm away this weekend, sorry
02/03/2017, 20:09 - Nathan: That does sound worth drinking to. I'm going to be out drinking in Camberwell on Sat with the other John but you've probably had enough Camberwell.
02/03/2017, 20:55 - John Begley: If I have recovered I'll come
03/03/2017, 11:53 - Luke: Cool! I'll try and come. Where you thinking? This sounds really bad but my chance of coming increases alot if it's in camber well :s sorry!
03/03/2017, 16:16 - Luke: Just had a recommendation for Tetsuo 2 for sci-fi night. My mate said it was better than 1, which we all remember as a classic I'm sure
03/03/2017, 17:20 - Olly: If there's three of you coming, then I guess I cab make the effort to go to camberwell tomorrow evening I guess. Nathan, Who is other John?
03/03/2017, 18:57 - Nathan: Noggi 'Noggarelli' Hopkins
04/03/2017, 11:36 - Spam: I might also come
04/03/2017, 13:52 - Nathan: Cool. I'm gonna be watching the football from half five in The Tiger (probably). Then regular drinking.
04/03/2017, 16:46 - Olly: I'll come 8ish probably
04/03/2017, 19:09 - Luke: Hey heading over now, you still in the tiger?
04/03/2017, 19:12 - Nathan: Yep
05/03/2017, 11:56 - Olly: Has demolition man been done on a sci fi night?
05/03/2017, 12:04 - Luke: Wow, a sci-fi film I've actually watched outside of sci-fi night! Though I was like 7 yrs old so would be up for watching again
05/03/2017, 12:57 - Nathan: I've seen it a couple of times so that's originally why it was excluded. I remember it being excellent though so it can go on the list for next season.
05/03/2017, 17:20 - Olly: Did you say there is no sci fi this Wednesday?
05/03/2017, 17:21 - Olly: Has thx 1138 been done already?
05/03/2017, 17:28 - Nathan: Correct. It hasn't but I've seen it. Anyone else?
05/03/2017, 17:29 - John Begley: Not seen it
05/03/2017, 17:36 - Luke: Me neither, though it's IMDB/RT ratio is the opposite of what I like
05/03/2017, 17:39 - Olly: Anyone want to watch thx or demolition man on wed, for a pseudo-sci fi night? Eg at johns?
05/03/2017, 17:41 - Nathan: lol
05/03/2017, 17:48 - Luke: However good that sounds, and I could probably even host a pseudo sci-fi night, Izzy saw an opening and I'm now busy this Wednesday!
06/03/2017, 12:49 - Luke: The remake of rollerball for next season? http://lwlies.com/articles/in-defence-of-rollerball-capitalist-satire/
17/03/2017, 15:43 - Nathan: I'm up for that on the condition that it's shorter than the original.
17/03/2017, 15:48 - Olly: You should be skiing. This had better just be a break for rum and hot chocolate, else your wasting your ski holiday using phones instead of skiing!
17/03/2017, 15:53 - Nathan: I'm a skiing lightweight. Very much a 10am-3pm kind of skier.
19/03/2017, 16:12 - Nathan: I survived! When and where is ski-fi week?
19/03/2017, 17:44 - Luke: That good?
19/03/2017, 19:04 - Olly: 'When is the next ski holiday' is the feeling i get after every ski holiday. So I'm glad Nathan is now one of us. I hope Tuckk survived too btw
19/03/2017, 19:09 - Nathan: Tuckk did survive and is now also a skier but sadly not invited to ski-fi. I don't make the rules up...
21/03/2017, 11:02 - Nathan: Anyone up for sci-fi night tomorrow?
21/03/2017, 11:25 - John Begley: Yes.
21/03/2017, 11:38 - Luke: Yep!
21/03/2017, 12:29 - James A: Yep
21/03/2017, 15:29 - Nathan: Good. Good. Good.
22/03/2017, 06:51 - Olly: In an unfriendly foreign land
22/03/2017, 11:03 - Nathan: St. Albans.
22/03/2017, 11:03 - Nathan: ?
22/03/2017, 11:16 - James A: Could Skype it
22/03/2017, 12:25 - Nathan: What time?
22/03/2017, 12:27 - Luke: What time are you thinking? I'm pretty free from mid afternoon
22/03/2017, 12:48 - Nathan: I'm pretty much at work until it stops raining.
22/03/2017, 12:57 - Luke: Lol
22/03/2017, 16:12 - Nathan: I'll be home by 5 if I don't get stabbed or run over.
22/03/2017, 16:13 - John Begley: I'm staying at home. I have a sinus infection and i cant be bothered. Tell me what you watch though and i will do my home work in realtime.
22/03/2017, 16:38 - Luke: See you in a bit!
22/03/2017, 18:03 - James A: Hey, something has come up at work, not gonna be over this evening, sorry
22/03/2017, 19:45 - Luke: We're watching Congress for those (John) watching at home
22/03/2017, 21:23 - Olly: Even less friendly than st albans - I'm in tel aviv
28/03/2017, 18:20 - Nathan: Sci-fi tomorrow?
28/03/2017, 19:44 - John Begley: Yes
28/03/2017, 19:47 - Spam: Yeah
28/03/2017, 20:14 - Olly: Ya
28/03/2017, 20:41 - James A: Yep
28/03/2017, 23:14 - Luke: Sorry got the housing group meeting :(
02/04/2017, 18:18 - Olly: I watched the Congress. The meta sci fi dissing within the film was excellent
04/04/2017, 14:14 - Nathan: Sci-fi tomorrow?
04/04/2017, 14:39 - Luke: Yep
04/04/2017, 15:18 - James A: Not sure yet, might get delayed. Don't wait for me to do food / film choice
04/04/2017, 20:41 - Olly: Yes
05/04/2017, 13:32 - Luke: What time?
05/04/2017, 14:52 - Nathan: 5
05/04/2017, 14:58 - John Begley: <Media omitted>
05/04/2017, 14:58 - John Begley: I'm here
05/04/2017, 15:16 - Luke: St Alban's?
05/04/2017, 15:17 - Nathan: Norwich?
05/04/2017, 15:36 - John Begley: Exactly. I've moved there.
05/04/2017, 15:36 - John Begley: Again
09/04/2017, 20:12 - Luke: Have we watched interstellar?
09/04/2017, 20:31 - Nathan: Everyone has watched Interstellar.
09/04/2017, 20:32 - Olly: And wished they hadn't
09/04/2017, 20:32 - John Begley: Ha
09/04/2017, 21:00 - Luke: So i should judge the person who just said it was their favourite film
09/04/2017, 21:01 - Nathan: Nah. It's great, don't listen to these spoilsports.
09/04/2017, 21:03 - John Begley: I can't really remember it. I've seen too many sci-fi films
09/04/2017, 21:23 - Olly: It's just too long. Who would have thought I would weight duration so highly? It is beautiful, but goes on for hours and hours.
09/04/2017, 21:26 - Olly: You would absolutely hate the plot of it though, Luke. Do you other guys agree with that? (comparing some plot themes to films Luke hates most)
09/04/2017, 21:30 - Luke: Tbf if there's not hugh Jackman and boxing robots I'm generally not interested
09/04/2017, 21:32 - Olly: It would definitely have improved it
11/04/2017, 21:21 - Nathan: Sci-fi tomorrow?
11/04/2017, 21:21 - John Begley: Yes
11/04/2017, 21:22 - Olly: Y
11/04/2017, 21:22 - Olly: ES
11/04/2017, 21:38 - Luke: I may come just for the film as I've got work. I know that makes no sense.
12/04/2017, 16:00 - Nathan: What time is Sci-fi?
12/04/2017, 16:08 - John Begley: I am on my way, so i hope soon
12/04/2017, 16:11 - Nathan: Right, I'll get dressed
12/04/2017, 16:12 - John Begley: That's ok.  I don't mind
12/04/2017, 16:31 - Luke: I may come round at 8 if i fancy watching a film
12/04/2017, 17:21 - Olly: It might be a sci fi film
12/04/2017, 17:29 - Luke: Yeh i know the risk
12/04/2017, 18:22 - Nathan: Mate, bevvies, bosh, Stormbird.
12/04/2017, 19:28 - Luke: Hopefully be over in 20. Where am I allowed to grab food from?
12/04/2017, 19:34 - Nathan: Bolu
12/04/2017, 19:34 - Nathan: It was good
14/04/2017, 15:34 - Nathan: <Media omitted>
14/04/2017, 16:22 - Olly: A good walking route I seem to remember. Is it good for cycling too? Are you on a mountain bike?
14/04/2017, 16:33 - Luke: Lol
14/04/2017, 18:12 - John Begley: Mega lol
25/04/2017, 14:11 - Nathan: Sci-fi?
25/04/2017, 14:31 - Spam: So early this week, but yes.
25/04/2017, 14:46 - Olly: Yes
25/04/2017, 14:47 - Luke: Sorry got housing group meeting
25/04/2017, 14:59 - Nathan: Early?
25/04/2017, 15:00 - Spam: Early reminder, you're making me feel like it's today
25/04/2017, 17:46 - John Begley: Yes!
26/04/2017, 07:18 - James A: Yep
26/04/2017, 12:09 - Nathan: Great! What time?
26/04/2017, 12:10 - John Begley: 4.35?
26/04/2017, 12:10 - Nathan: Ok
26/04/2017, 12:46 - Luke: If there's a warphole that allows time travel does that count as sci fi for sci-fi night purposes?
26/04/2017, 13:17 - Olly: If say so. If it's as sci fi as that chick-flick we watched then it clubs, right? And extra points if the romance is between a person and their future selves
26/04/2017, 13:17 - Olly: *I'd
26/04/2017, 13:17 - Olly: *counts, not clubs
26/04/2017, 13:42 - Luke: Cool let's add Jubilee (1978) to next season. No self-romance but there is Queen Elizabeth I in a girl gang
26/04/2017, 13:53 - Nathan: Alright, it's on the list. We need 6 more. At least.
26/04/2017, 18:46 - James A: On bus at Oval
26/04/2017, 18:47 - Nathan: Food vote?
26/04/2017, 18:48 - Spam: So far
Morleys
Medium pizza
Falafels
Good pizza
26/04/2017, 18:49 - James A: Bolu
26/04/2017, 18:50 - James A: A shock development I'm sure
26/04/2017, 18:51 - Nathan: Falafel, Morley's, good pizza, bolu
26/04/2017, 18:53 - James A: 2nd vote: good pizza
26/04/2017, 18:53 - John Begley: Prick
28/04/2017, 07:27 - John Begley: https://youtu.be/Ur7_jT-obmc
28/04/2017, 10:37 - Luke: More sci-fi for next season: the fountain (Hugh Jackman, good RT/IMDB ratio, what more could you want), contact, dark city,  artificial intelligence, the dark crystal (puppet-fi), 2010 (sequel to 2001, if we ever watch it), 12 monkeys, gattaca.

Also what was Weds film? Worth a homework watch or not?
28/04/2017, 14:49 - Nathan: You will hate The Fountain. It's on the list!
28/04/2017, 14:59 - Nathan: Dark City is my uncle's favourite film, it's shit, let's watch it. Dark Crystal is muppets, pretty sure it's not sci-fi. Anyone object if I ban it? Gattaca and 2010 both already on the list. I'd like to see 12 Monkeys and Contact again, been a long time. I like A.I. but I remember it being very long, I'll put it on the list but doubt we'll ever see it. Cheers
28/04/2017, 15:01 - Nathan: We watched The Arrival. It was a classic 3/10.
28/04/2017, 15:50 - Luke: Brilliant, thanks for watching it for me. I did find dark crystal on a sci-fi list, but I'm a big fan of vetoes, so let's ban it! And yeh if more than 2 ppl have watched one of the films then let's probably get rid of it again?
28/04/2017, 16:36 - John Begley: Puppet-fi, hahahaha
28/04/2017, 16:38 - Nathan: Demolition man
Tetsuo 2

28/04/2017, 16:39 - Nathan: Anyone want an early veto from the long list for next season?
28/04/2017, 16:41 - Olly: Isn't contact the worst film ever created?
28/04/2017, 16:43 - Nathan: Nope
28/04/2017, 16:45 - John Begley: I've seen 12 monkey about 12 times so i want to veto that. It's also a great film which isn't consistent with the list
28/04/2017, 16:55 - Nathan: Anyone else feel the same?
28/04/2017, 18:55 - James A: Would watch any of them - in fact there's a few I've wanted to watch for a while. remember A.I. as being a bit bad, but maybe it's worth a critical reappraisal eh?
28/04/2017, 19:56 - John Begley: At 1.3 though
28/04/2017, 20:15 - Luke: Have people watched Looper? If not that may be a good one to add to next season as it actually looks good
28/04/2017, 20:25 - John Begley: It's not. Put it on.
28/04/2017, 20:25 - John Begley: You might hate it luke it's severe chicken Egg
28/04/2017, 20:32 - Luke: 93% on rotten tomatoes. Fuck it. I just accept time travel films don't make sense now
28/04/2017, 21:21 - James A: Just watched it. But put it on, I'll just vote it off here and there. It'll be the new Avalon.
28/04/2017, 21:22 - Nathan: I thought it was pretty good. But don't worry, I'll vote it off when James doesn't.
28/04/2017, 21:30 - Luke: Lol, I'll just watch looper outside of sci-fi night. I forget the rest of you watch sci-fi recreationally
29/04/2017, 07:15 - Nathan: Prometheus?
30/04/2017, 09:46 - Olly: And guardians of the galaxy. I watched the sequel on Friday and it reminded me how I should watch the original again
30/04/2017, 12:22 - Nathan: Unfortunately it's banned.
01/05/2017, 09:25 - Spam: From the Barbican list I said I was goin look up: Dead Man's Letters, and THX 1138. Assuming they haven't already been watched.
02/05/2017, 16:19 - Nathan: Seen THX, it's boring. Dead man's letters looks like a winner though.
02/05/2017, 16:19 - Nathan: Who's coming tomorrow?
02/05/2017, 16:21 - John Begley: I am
02/05/2017, 16:26 - Spam: Yes
02/05/2017, 16:26 - Spam: ...wait no
02/05/2017, 16:48 - Luke: Yep but late!
02/05/2017, 17:21 - Olly: Yes. Possibly with anti-terrorist paraphernalia - if anyone needa a new cup
02/05/2017, 17:39 - John Begley: I don't know what that means. But I would like a cup
02/05/2017, 17:40 - Luke: I'm interested to see it. Not sure I'll feel comfortable drinking from it
02/05/2017, 17:43 - Olly: We all drink from the cup of propaganda and brain-washing. Why not make it literal?
02/05/2017, 18:01 - Luke: Don't you need sunglasses for that
02/05/2017, 18:23 - James A: I'll probably make an appearance
03/05/2017, 15:34 - Nathan: What time?
03/05/2017, 15:38 - Olly: I can make it early for one day only - 5 or so?
03/05/2017, 15:41 - Nathan: Okay!
03/05/2017, 16:07 - John Begley: I will be late, for me. Still before 6
03/05/2017, 16:13 - Luke: 8, sorry!
03/05/2017, 16:15 - John Begley: Can we forward vote for Morrison pizzas? We can eat more food for less money, and it will definitely be better than shit pizza and probably quicker than good pizza.
03/05/2017, 16:28 - Nathan: It's certainly an option. But definitely slower than good pizza. Oven capacity = 2 pizzi.
03/05/2017, 16:29 - John Begley: Does 1 pizzi = 3 pizzas?
03/05/2017, 16:41 - Luke: As I'm coming so late I'll just grab a bolu on my way in. Though I like your attempts to get Nu shit pizza going John
03/05/2017, 16:48 - James A: +1 on Bolu, no doubt
03/05/2017, 18:17 - James A: On the bus
03/05/2017, 20:08 - Nathan: Oi, where are you?
03/05/2017, 20:13 - Luke: Bolu, sorry!
09/05/2017, 21:54 - Nathan: Who's coming tomorrow?
09/05/2017, 21:55 - John Begley: I am
09/05/2017, 21:57 - Olly: And i. According to public transport predictions, I might actually get there earlier now that I live further away. Is this ironic?
09/05/2017, 21:58 - Spam: Yes
09/05/2017, 21:58 - Spam: To coming
09/05/2017, 21:59 - John Begley: I don't know about ironic. I don't think it makes sense though
09/05/2017, 21:59 - John Begley: Do you still finish work at the same time?
09/05/2017, 22:01 - Luke: I may arrive at 8.15 with a doner kebab, but don't plan around me. After this I'm not working for a while on Wednesday though so will stop doing this annoying late arrival. And yeh Oli, aren't you doing the exact same journey from work to Nathan's?
09/05/2017, 22:03 - Olly: Nope, a more convoluted and apparently quicker journey. I doubt you really want to know the details
09/05/2017, 22:07 - Nathan: I might be late tomorrow. Probably home by half five though.
09/05/2017, 22:11 - Olly: (It's essentially because conservation of bicycles is violated)
10/05/2017, 10:37 - James A: I'll be over around half six
10/05/2017, 17:27 - John Begley: I'm in the pub
10/05/2017, 17:32 - Nathan: Leaving work now.
10/05/2017, 17:49 - Spam: Sorry guys I can no longer come
10/05/2017, 18:13 - Olly: I'll be there shortly
12/05/2017, 22:06 - Olly: I finally remembered the sci fi film I forgot the other night: Equilibrium. It's the same as the matrix, and royally awesome
12/05/2017, 22:17 - Nathan: Cool. On the list.
16/05/2017, 09:27 - Nathan: Who's coming tomorrow?
16/05/2017, 09:32 - John Begley: I'm in Naples
16/05/2017, 09:34 - Nathan: I'll set up a live stream
16/05/2017, 09:35 - Spam: Yes
16/05/2017, 10:46 - Luke joined using this group's invite link
16/05/2017, 18:33 - Olly: Yes
16/05/2017, 18:52 - James A: Not sure, possibly not
17/05/2017, 17:16 - Nathan: What time are you guys getting to mine?
17/05/2017, 17:32 - Olly: 630 or so today
17/05/2017, 17:45 - Spam: Likewise
20/05/2017, 20:58 - Luke: I finally found Jubilee 1978. Luckily I checked it, as it's dubbed in Russian
20/05/2017, 21:19 - Nathan: Great?
22/05/2017, 12:07 - Nathan: Anyone up for a BBQ on Saturday?
22/05/2017, 12:18 - Olly: I'll be on the isle of Wight
22/05/2017, 12:19 - John Begley: I might be
22/05/2017, 14:28 - Luke: Yeah maybe
22/05/2017, 14:28 - Luke: Burgess?
22/05/2017, 14:48 - Nathan: Yeah
22/05/2017, 15:06 - Luke: Cool
23/05/2017, 17:01 - Nathan: Sci-fi night?
23/05/2017, 17:02 - Spam: No can't do
23/05/2017, 17:12 - Luke: Yep!
23/05/2017, 19:36 - Olly: Yabadabado
23/05/2017, 19:54 - Nathan: And Tyler too?
24/05/2017, 14:28 - Luke: What time you thinking?
24/05/2017, 14:29 - Nathan: Dunno. At work but tempted by very early finish
24/05/2017, 14:36 - John Begley: Can't today
24/05/2017, 14:38 - Luke: Currently chilling in hampstead heath but will be in Camberwell around 5 I think
24/05/2017, 15:02 - Nathan: Ok cool
24/05/2017, 15:20 - Luke: Actually more like 4.30, wasn't as lost as I thought
24/05/2017, 16:11 - Nathan: Ok, I'm home
24/05/2017, 16:50 - James A: Will be over about half six
24/05/2017, 18:20 - James A: Are you guys in pub or flat?
24/05/2017, 18:24 - Nathan: Flat
26/05/2017, 11:58 - John Begley: Still BBQ ing tomorrow? What time?
26/05/2017, 11:58 - Nathan: Yeah. Not sure. Lunchtime? Up for it?
26/05/2017, 12:02 - Luke: I'll be training till 2, but I train next to Burgess park so will come straight after. Think Iz is up for it aswell.
26/05/2017, 12:02 - John Begley: Yes. Maybe about 2-3 ish though.
26/05/2017, 12:02 - John Begley: Victoria is coming too
26/05/2017, 12:02 - John Begley: Nathan, tennis in the morning?
26/05/2017, 12:04 - Nathan: Yeah, cool.
26/05/2017, 12:05 - John Begley: Bum. What time?
26/05/2017, 12:09 - John Begley: 9?
26/05/2017, 12:14 - Nathan: Ok. Let's go for a half 2 BBQ start. Tennis at midday?
26/05/2017, 12:20 - John Begley: Ok midday
30/05/2017, 22:27 - Nathan: Sci-fi?
30/05/2017, 22:34 - Olly: Yep
30/05/2017, 23:48 - Luke: Sorry got housing group meeting!
31/05/2017, 06:31 - John Begley: Yep
31/05/2017, 06:31 - John Begley: What time?
31/05/2017, 07:32 - Nathan: 3
31/05/2017, 07:52 - Spam: Sorry goin have a swim in Thames!
31/05/2017, 13:38 - Nathan: What time are you coming John?
31/05/2017, 13:55 - James A: Forgot to reply, not about tonight as going to Cornwall
31/05/2017, 15:07 - John Begley: 5.15
01/06/2017, 20:33 - Luke: What you guys watch last night? Any good?
01/06/2017, 21:22 - John Begley: Lifeforce. Very feminist.
01/06/2017, 22:05 - Luke: Perfect
04/06/2017, 20:43 - Olly: Barbican is doing sci fi music exhibition! Sci fi outing at some point?
04/06/2017, 21:15 - John Begley: Good call
04/06/2017, 21:36 - Luke: 👍🏻
05/06/2017, 16:56 - Olly: It closes at 830pm I Fridays (most days it's 630). So could do it one Friday?
05/06/2017, 16:57 - Nathan: I vote for next Friday
05/06/2017, 16:57 - John Begley: 2
05/06/2017, 16:57 - Olly: Btw I watched the end of casshern. A good film! (especially considering its length!). [I originally posted this to the wrong group]
05/06/2017, 16:59 - Olly: Did next Fri mean 16th? I think I can do that date too
05/06/2017, 17:01 - Nathan: Yep. 3?
05/06/2017, 19:22 - Olly: 4
06/06/2017, 18:13 - James A: Sounds good, will check plans. As an aside does anyone know of a good place to get a bike service done in South London?
06/06/2017, 18:13 - John Begley: Luke? Isn't that your job?
06/06/2017, 18:54 - Luke: Haha, yeh. Yeh so I do council work on street corners doing free bike safety checks and small fixes which I could let you know when they happen. But if you want a full service and your bike isn't too fancy (£600+) I could give it a full service at mates rates. Apart from that not sure about bike shops, really just depends on what mechanics work there and none of my mates currently do bikeshop work.

Back to Scifi, will check when I finish work the Barbican Friday night
06/06/2017, 18:56 - Luke: Also is there any Scifi tomorrow night?
06/06/2017, 19:15 - John Begley: I can't I have I work leaving do
06/06/2017, 19:15 - John Begley: Not mine
06/06/2017, 19:17 - Luke: Aaaa is this week  the week Nathan's in Croatia? Is slurry Sunday still on this Sunday?
06/06/2017, 19:42 - Olly: Yes to both Luke
06/06/2017, 19:42 - Olly: (Nathan said he's back Thurs or something)
06/06/2017, 20:12 - Nathan: I'll be genuinely amazed is anyone shows up to slurry Sunday. But I'll be there.
06/06/2017, 21:38 - John Begley: Haha. I'm in. From what time does it start
06/06/2017, 21:49 - Luke: Yeh if it's on I'm in too
06/06/2017, 22:00 - Olly: I've purchased all the slurry I could get my hands on, especially for sunday
06/06/2017, 22:35 - Nathan: I reckon it starts at midday. Could be preceded by arduino club if all your bits have arrived John?
07/06/2017, 06:48 - John Begley: No. They are coming from China I think some of them arrive in july
07/06/2017, 07:21 - Olly: Have you made the fractal music machine yet? I imagine it'll need a rasp-pi so might not be allowed in arduino club anyhow...
07/06/2017, 07:24 - John Begley: I've ordered an arduino Uno r3. You will be providing the chain mail Oli.
07/06/2017, 07:26 - Olly: Mithril silver has an even longer delivery estimate
07/06/2017, 07:35 - John Begley: That's ok. The most important thing as you quite rightly pointed out is that it is shimmery
11/06/2017, 11:24 - Olly: When is the horror beginning? I can get to yours by 1
11/06/2017, 11:33 - Nathan: I'm half an hour into 2001
11/06/2017, 11:36 - Olly: Anyone else showing up?
11/06/2017, 11:41 - John Begley: I'm leaving g now
11/06/2017, 11:43 - Olly: It sure is nice weather for sitting indoors watching films. Any chance of sci fi in the park?
11/06/2017, 11:43 - Nathan: I think so
11/06/2017, 12:43 - John Begley: We can leave the film's running when we leave to ensure we aren't cheating
13/06/2017, 21:20 - Nathan: Sci-fi?
13/06/2017, 21:32 - John Begley: Yes please
13/06/2017, 21:36 - Olly: Yep
13/06/2017, 21:54 - Olly: <Media omitted>
13/06/2017, 21:58 - John Begley: Is this what you will throw at them?
13/06/2017, 22:11 - Olly: Ha ha. You've come up with a much simpler solution than I had come up with
13/06/2017, 22:18 - John Begley: Haha
14/06/2017, 11:19 - James A: I'll be over for about half six
14/06/2017, 16:32 - Luke: Think I'll come down sometime after 5.30
14/06/2017, 17:21 - Nathan: Bevvies on the green, lads?
14/06/2017, 17:21 - John Begley: Bosh
14/06/2017, 18:15 - James A: Mate
15/06/2017, 07:01 - Nathan: If you say it loud enough you'll always sound precocious, baobab.
15/06/2017, 07:03 - John Begley: Haha
15/06/2017, 12:06 - Nathan: Who's going to the Barbican thing tomorrow?
15/06/2017, 12:24 - Luke: Shit, don't finish work until too late.
15/06/2017, 12:25 - John Begley: I completely forgot and I'm going to an exhibition about Hokusai at the bm
15/06/2017, 12:41 - James A: I've got a work thing tomorrow, soz :/
15/06/2017, 14:45 - Olly: I can, but shall we move it to a more convenient date for people?
15/06/2017, 14:46 - Nathan: It'll never work. Just look what happened to fight night.
15/06/2017, 14:50 - Luke: What's fight night?
15/06/2017, 15:14 - Nathan: Exactly.
15/06/2017, 17:54 - Olly: Let's do it then, if you still fancy it - what about barbican at 5ish or 6 tomorrow?
15/06/2017, 22:26 - Nathan: Ok. 6.
16/06/2017, 07:25 - Olly: Ok
19/06/2017, 16:15 - James A: Not sure if I'll be about this Wednesday or not - busy week. Still up for some sort of music shenanigans but not this week
20/06/2017, 17:35 - Nathan: Bogus Vortex?
20/06/2017, 17:36 - John Begley: Is that our band?
20/06/2017, 17:44 - Nathan: Just another suggestion
20/06/2017, 17:45 - Nathan: Sci-fi tomorrow?
20/06/2017, 17:45 - Nathan: Beer today?
20/06/2017, 17:50 - John Begley: Sci fi tomorrow. No beer today.
20/06/2017, 18:10 - Olly: Sci fi, not band-fi tomorrow?
20/06/2017, 18:11 - Olly: I've written a song. But it'll keep to next week. And the synth will be better then too
20/06/2017, 18:12 - Nathan: Our bassist pulled out. Great work on the song.
20/06/2017, 18:13 - Olly: I wouldn't say that until you hear it
20/06/2017, 18:56 - Olly: I like fractal dimension. But sadly already taken according to Google
20/06/2017, 18:57 - Olly: Bogus vortex is a goodn though
20/06/2017, 19:01 - Olly: Strange attractor also taken
21/06/2017, 10:33 - Olly: Don't think I can make sci fi today after all - I just remembered I meant to meet some Albanites tonight
21/06/2017, 11:48 - Luke: Me neither, I have bike work :(
21/06/2017, 11:58 - James A: The Albanites sounds like a Libertines-esque 2000s band. Have a good one!
23/06/2017, 15:07 - Olly: Anyone fancy board game or pub night some point this weekend?
23/06/2017, 15:42 - Nathan: I'm away
23/06/2017, 16:12 - John Begley: I think I am incredibly busy. Ill get back to you though
23/06/2017, 16:23 - Luke: I would fancy board game on Sunday evening? But apart from that I'm busy!
24/06/2017, 07:11 - John Begley: We can do Sunday evening at ours if you want?
24/06/2017, 12:27 - Olly: If it doesn't start too late then I'm up for it
24/06/2017, 13:05 - John Begley: It has to start after 6.30 as I will be in Essex during the day?
24/06/2017, 23:11 - Olly: I'm more of a fan of a 3 or 4 o clock start, to give plenty of game time. (Sunday is the one day I should really at least make an effort to go to bed early). Never mind, another weekend...
27/06/2017, 21:05 - Nathan: Sci-fi?
27/06/2017, 21:05 - Spam: For sure
27/06/2017, 21:05 - Spam: Macs back
27/06/2017, 21:12 - Luke: May, got a housing meeting. 
Was last week's film any good? Homework worthy?
27/06/2017, 21:13 - Luke: *I meant no, not may :s
27/06/2017, 21:14 - Nathan: Forget last week. Season 6 starts this week. Very strong lineup.
27/06/2017, 21:15 - Nathan: Includes some films I literally wouldn't mind seeing
27/06/2017, 21:15 - Luke: Season 6? I feel like rules are being broken in my absence. You definitely haven't watched Animatrix yet!
27/06/2017, 21:16 - Olly: What happened to band fi?
27/06/2017, 21:17 - Nathan: Rained off
27/06/2017, 21:17 - Olly: Classic rehearsal skipping excuse
27/06/2017, 21:18 - Olly: Yep I'll be at sci fi
27/06/2017, 21:59 - James A: Yeah I'll probably be about
27/06/2017, 23:53 - John Begley: Would like to be. Not sure though
28/06/2017, 15:34 - Nathan: What time?
28/06/2017, 16:21 - Spam: 5:45 earliest
28/06/2017, 18:15 - James A: On the bus, flat or pub?
28/06/2017, 18:17 - Nathan: Flat
29/06/2017, 08:03 - You removed Luke
02/07/2017, 22:10 - Luke: Wow you removed my old number. Such efficient sci-fi night bureaucracy.

Also have people seen 'Earth girls are easy'?
02/07/2017, 22:11 - Olly: Classic Luke film
02/07/2017, 22:12 - Nathan: Nope, one for season 7...
02/07/2017, 22:12 - Luke: #FemFi
02/07/2017, 22:13 - Nathan: Btw, you've got homework. The Ice Pirates was excellent.
02/07/2017, 22:14 - Luke: Really? It got 9% on RT?
02/07/2017, 22:14 - Nathan: Yeah, hard to explain that away...
02/07/2017, 22:15 - Olly: Last 5 mins worth watching?
02/07/2017, 22:15 - Nathan: Yes!
03/07/2017, 15:18 - Luke: Yeh the last 5 mins are well worth watching! What a great film.
03/07/2017, 16:23 - Nathan: Castration, space herpes, the stiff belt...
03/07/2017, 16:25 - Luke: O the stiff belt. 
My favourite was the fact swords were the choice weapon in a world with lasers
04/07/2017, 15:08 - Nathan: Anyone around for sci-fi tomorrow?
04/07/2017, 15:21 - John Begley: Yes
04/07/2017, 15:52 - Olly: Yes
04/07/2017, 16:07 - Luke: Yeh, but have work so will arrive about 8 so pick/start the film without me
04/07/2017, 17:30 - Spam: Perfect weather for sci-if, drinks in the park first? But yes
05/07/2017, 12:41 - James A: Yep will be over around 6:40

12/07/2017, 14:32 - Luke: What time?
12/07/2017, 14:49 - Nathan: Will be home from half 4 but maybe arduino club for an hour?
12/07/2017, 17:41 - Olly: Bus issues. Won't make it tonight
12/07/2017, 18:17 - Spam: I'll be there by 6:45
12/07/2017, 19:30 - John Begley: What bus issues?
12/07/2017, 20:14 - Olly: Hemel hempstead bus arrival failure
12/07/2017, 20:14 - John Begley: Fucker
14/07/2017, 16:01 - Olly: Hey Sam, I wasn't sure I could make it, but I am free tomorrow afterall. Are you still doing bbq etc?
14/07/2017, 16:37 - Spam: Hey, great. No Bbq I'm afraid. But football 1:30pm Regent's Park, v mixed standard (pls come numbers are low!). Then drinks from 3ish, either in the park or in pub nearby. You can of course just for drinks.
14/07/2017, 17:20 - Olly: Cool! I avoid football as a general rule, but will join you at 3
14/07/2017, 18:58 - Spam: John, what's your final verdict?
14/07/2017, 22:10 - John Begley: Can't make it i'm afraid.
14/07/2017, 22:10 - John Begley: Sorry
15/07/2017, 10:52 - Spam: Weather's disappointing, Masons Arms from 3pm!
18/07/2017, 20:01 - Nathan: Sci-fi?
18/07/2017, 20:24 - Olly: Can't I'm afraid. I am getting sci fi withdrawal symptoms though
18/07/2017, 20:40 - John Begley: I'm in Lancaster
19/07/2017, 07:05 - James A: Can't do this evening or next week I'm afraid
19/07/2017, 08:16 - Luke: Yeh, I'm up for it
19/07/2017, 15:10 - Spam: I think I've got to go to some guys leaving work drinks
19/07/2017, 15:10 - Spam: Tempted to just do a runner to sci-fi though
19/07/2017, 15:11 - Nathan: How much do you like the guy? And why is he leaving on a sci-fi night?
19/07/2017, 15:12 - Spam: I actually really like him, but it's a question of how many people I don't like will join, which is most people
19/07/2017, 15:12 - Spam: Good question re night
19/07/2017, 15:12 - Spam: Don't believe I was consulted
19/07/2017, 16:31 - Nathan: How many people you don't like are going to sci-fi night?
19/07/2017, 16:45 - Spam: Just a couple
19/07/2017, 17:22 - Luke: Sam you coming? Otherwise we're going to eat now.
19/07/2017, 17:25 - Spam: Yeah sorry not coming, go eat!
21/07/2017, 16:36 - Spam: a) what did you watch?
b) what's the plan tomorrow?
21/07/2017, 17:07 - Nathan: Mr Nobody @ 1.2x
21/07/2017, 17:08 - Nathan: Good, but confusing. Possibly meaningless.
21/07/2017, 17:10 - Nathan: Tomorrow hinges on weather. If it actually rains, then I don't think the Camberwell Fair will be much fun.
21/07/2017, 22:53 - Olly: " Good, but confusing. Possibly meaningless.". Is that answering the second question -  your plan for tomorrow?
21/07/2017, 22:54 - Olly: If so, I might be interested in joining. What are you up to?
21/07/2017, 23:04 - Nathan: There's a music thing on Camberwell Green 12-9pm. Two stages, one of which is called The Wormfood Stage. But looks like it's gonna rain.
21/07/2017, 23:17 - Olly: Well, let me know if the fun is going to happen
22/07/2017, 15:49 - Luke: I'm guessing Camberwell plans are rained off?
22/07/2017, 15:49 - Nathan: Well. I'm here.
22/07/2017, 15:51 - Luke: In the green??
22/07/2017, 15:51 - Nathan: Yep. It's very very wet.
22/07/2017, 15:55 - Luke: Yeh, I'm currently soaked fixing bikes in Chelsea. Think if it keeps raining I'll not make it to Camberwell. How's the 2 stages of music?
22/07/2017, 16:18 - Nathan: Wet. Don't come.
22/07/2017, 16:43 - Olly: Any festivities this evening, instead?
22/07/2017, 19:50 - Nathan: I'm going to focus on drying off.
23/07/2017, 12:41 - Olly: Robin, can you remind me my flight times, or send me over my boarding passes? Cheers
23/07/2017, 15:31 - Nathan: Sorry, can't help.
23/07/2017, 15:50 - Olly: Wrong group...
26/07/2017, 08:00 - Olly: Is there sci fi today?
26/07/2017, 08:05 - Nathan: No
26/07/2017, 09:57 - Olly: Ok. Which films did I miss the last couple weeks? I'll catch up if I can
26/07/2017, 09:58 - Luke: Mr Nobody. But we heavily advise 1.2 speed
26/07/2017, 09:58 - Luke: And no expectations that he film will start making sense
26/07/2017, 10:02 - Nathan: And before that was These Final Hours I think...
26/07/2017, 10:06 - Luke: Yeh like The Road but not as good
26/07/2017, 10:08 - Nathan: But more fun
26/07/2017, 10:09 - Luke: True
29/07/2017, 22:22 - Olly: Watched 'these final hours'. A wicked looking party in that film. Makes me want to techno it up
30/07/2017, 03:38 - Nathan: 414?
30/07/2017, 10:32 - Olly: Thy will be done
01/08/2017, 07:49 - Nathan: Empire of the Ants next season?
01/08/2017, 07:50 - Nathan: How to join Rotten Tomatoes’ Zero Per Cent Club

01/08/2017, 22:22 - Nathan: Sci-fi tomorrow?
02/08/2017, 06:35 - John Begley: Today? Yes.
02/08/2017, 06:40 - James A: Can't this week (again) but should be around next week
02/08/2017, 06:56 - Luke: I may pop along at 8 and join for the film. But depends on when I can get away from work
02/08/2017, 07:00 - Luke: Though just checked the weather and work may get rained off early so :)
02/08/2017, 12:07 - Nathan: What time?
02/08/2017, 13:53 - John Begley: Hopefully 4.45
02/08/2017, 14:02 - Nathan: Ok. I'm going home now. It's too wet to work.
02/08/2017, 16:31 - Luke: Work got cancelled because of the rain so will be paid to be at Scifi night from 6
02/08/2017, 16:31 - Nathan: Awesome
02/08/2017, 16:51 - Luke: Literally too wet to work
03/08/2017, 21:33 - Luke: John what's the name of the Scifi book series you said was great last night?
04/08/2017, 06:48 - John Begley: Red rising. And I wouldn't admit to saying it's great publicly. But I loved it.
04/08/2017, 06:48 - John Begley: It basically Hunger games meets Harry potter in space
04/08/2017, 07:07 - Luke: Cheers!
04/08/2017, 16:12 - Spam: What was watched?
04/08/2017, 16:13 - Spam: And at what speed?
04/08/2017, 16:13 - John Begley: Sleeper. Mostly 1, with a touch of 1.1
04/08/2017, 16:21 - Nathan: Everyone: Come to Supernormal!
05/08/2017, 20:54 - Nathan: Shitwife
05/08/2017, 22:21 - Luke: Prefer shitmat. He still there DJing badly?
08/08/2017, 11:22 - Olly: Is sci fi happening tomorrow?
08/08/2017, 11:34 - Nathan: Probably. Feeling a bit rough though. Let you know tomorrow morning.
09/08/2017, 09:52 - Luke: My work has a great chance of being rained off again. So if Scifi is on I should be there on the pay of Lambeth council :)
09/08/2017, 09:53 - Nathan: I think it's on. But also I think I might have flu. I guess you can take your chance.
09/08/2017, 09:54 - John Begley: Hmmmm
09/08/2017, 09:55 - John Begley: Btw - I'm pretty sure that my mental cousin has changed his name by deed pole to Dr Sting Thunderbolt
09/08/2017, 10:26 - Nathan: Been thinking it over, and no, I don't think it's a good name.
09/08/2017, 10:43 - John Begley: Haha
09/08/2017, 11:33 - James A: Doubt I'll be able to make it tonight, likely around next week
09/08/2017, 12:43 - Luke: Yeh work got called off. So I'm up for some Sci-fi tonight
09/08/2017, 12:46 - Olly: If transport is working well then I'll be there. Nathan, is it ok for you to wear a bio hazard suit, and cover your house in plastic sheeting?
09/08/2017, 12:47 - Luke: Is it normally the hazard that wears the suit?
09/08/2017, 12:49 - Olly: If everyone just agreed it to be that way, wouldn't life be so much easier?
09/08/2017, 12:50 - Olly: I'm not sure the plastic sheeting will have any benefit. Good for appearances though.
09/08/2017, 12:53 - Luke: Will also make it easier to comply with John's dusting standards
09/08/2017, 13:15 - John Begley: I'm in
09/08/2017, 14:23 - Spam: What are the chances of me getting the flu do you think Nathan?
09/08/2017, 14:52 - Nathan: Depends if you sit next to me.

09/08/2017, 22:56 - Olly: Why were the other players in the game behaving like bots - waiting for gaymerge, if they were real players??
10/08/2017, 06:36 - John Begley: Good question, and would you play a game wear your job was to assassinate somebody two minutes in and then die?

20/08/2017, 20:18 - Olly: In my short sci fi career, I've seen some bad films. If they truly are the worst, well, it's hard to imagine...
21/08/2017, 09:37 - Luke: Wow. O the good old days when quintet was as bad as it got.

25/08/2017, 07:05 - Luke: Has this made an appearance yet? Feels like it would have fitted in with early Scifi nights
27/08/2017, 09:53 - Nathan: It hasn't. Don't know why.
27/08/2017, 09:53 - Nathan: BBQ in Burgess Park tomorrow?

05/09/2017, 13:51 - John Begley: Nothing?
05/09/2017, 13:51 - John Begley: Fine
05/09/2017, 13:56 - Olly: Nice! It's a shame I wasn't born when volume 2 was being watched. But I'm glad that sci fi posters for ones where I was present are getting ever closer to beginning reality!

06/09/2017, 13:19 - Luke: What time for Scifi today?
06/09/2017, 13:23 - John Begley: I'm going to speed up. I'm thinking of doing the next 4 simultaneously
06/09/2017, 13:24 - Luke: Like 1 poster covering all the seasons?
06/09/2017, 13:30 - James A: Like a Four Seasons pizza? A Four Seasons Poster?
06/09/2017, 13:31 - John Begley: Ha. No, I would just collect all the images and process them in bulk
06/09/2017, 13:32 - John Begley: Still one poster per season. I'm not mad.
06/09/2017, 14:04 - Olly: I thought Sam volunteered to do the grunt work for you
06/09/2017, 14:06 - John Begley: I didn't get much buy in for that idea. I got the feeling it wasn't going to happen
06/09/2017, 15:09 - Nathan: I'll be back about half 5.
06/09/2017, 17:01 - Luke: Cool, see you then!

13/09/2017, 09:58 - John Begley: I'll be there at 430
13/09/2017, 12:21 - Olly: Sorry can't make it tonight

13/09/2017, 18:09 - Spam: Where?
13/09/2017, 18:10 - Luke: Pub
13/09/2017, 18:10 - Spam: Excellent
13/09/2017, 18:15 - James A: On the bus, let me know if you move from pub
13/09/2017, 19:31 - John Begley: my SoberingThoughts top score is 17 on difficulty level easy and I have completed 9 days so far!
14/09/2017, 08:19 - Luke: What did you watch last night? Any good?
14/09/2017, 08:21 - Nathan: WarGames. An 80s teen version of Colossus.
14/09/2017, 08:45 - Luke: Worth watching?
14/09/2017, 08:48 - Nathan: Was a good laugh. Inexplicable tour groups, a pterodactyl, an acoustic coupler.
14/09/2017, 08:49 - Luke: Cool. Isn't an acoustic coupler just a telephone?
14/09/2017, 08:59 - John Begley: That's how it looked to me. It was good, made no sense though
14/09/2017, 09:00 - John Begley: There was wave after wave of tourists having guided tours around a military base, including the room where they can control launching nuclear weapons
14/09/2017, 09:02 - Spam: No chicken and egg, but a computer (aka the beef burger) whose logical is impossible to follow
14/09/2017, 09:03 - Spam: You should probably catch up though, as the first half hour of next sci fi will be a detailed discussion of the film, to be released as our first podcast
14/09/2017, 09:04 - John Begley: Its easy: Noughts and crosses is a boring game, ergo, nuclear war is bad
14/09/2017, 09:04 - Luke: Yeh that makes sense!
14/09/2017, 09:05 - Luke: Cool, sounds like a great Scifi night film
14/09/2017, 12:28 - Olly: I watched embers the other (sci fi catchup) night - it was totally awesome!
20/09/2017, 13:46 - Luke: Any Scifi today?
20/09/2017, 14:08 - Nathan: No, none.
20/09/2017, 14:15 - Luke: Shame! See you all at Xmas!
20/09/2017, 14:36 - Olly: Enjoy being back at school!
20/09/2017, 17:56 - Luke: Cheers!

22/09/2017, 17:43 - Nathan: Yes please
27/09/2017, 11:40 - James A: Sounds like no sci fi tonight?
27/09/2017, 11:40 - Nathan: Yeah, it's Sparks night
27/09/2017, 12:14 - Spam: What is that?
27/09/2017, 12:31 - Nathan: It's where we all go and see Sparks play at the shepherd's bush empire.
27/09/2017, 12:32 - Luke: Are you talking in 3rd person?
27/09/2017, 12:33 - Nathan: First person plural
03/10/2017, 09:03 - Nathan: Sci-fi tomorrow?
03/10/2017, 09:04 - John Begley: I thought you'd turned your back on sci-fi night forever.
03/10/2017, 09:04 - John Begley: I'm in
03/10/2017, 09:06 - Nathan: Great! Also I propose a group outing to see Blade Runner next week. Anyone interested?
03/10/2017, 09:07 - John Begley: Yes
03/10/2017, 09:18 - Luke: Blade runner outing on Scifi night or other night?
03/10/2017, 09:19 - Nathan: Any night except Tuesday for me.
03/10/2017, 09:27 - Luke: Friday?
03/10/2017, 09:46 - Nathan: I would like to invite you to the Doodle poll “Blade Runner”. Please follow the link - https://doodle.com/poll/g7xeta6cpmgakkup
03/10/2017, 09:46 - Nathan: Radically simple.
03/10/2017, 12:42 - Olly: Yes you tomorrow. (And totally radical survey done).
03/10/2017, 12:44 - Olly: Also, there will be an unveiling of the first-ever specially-for-scifi-night-created computer game tomorrow. Prepared to be blown away by graphics beyond imagination.
03/10/2017, 13:02 - Nathan: I am genuinely very excited.
03/10/2017, 13:11 - John Begley: I am excited too. Posters games, badges (although Luke never actually did them) we have proper brand...
03/10/2017, 13:54 - Luke: The badges have an early 2018 release date
04/10/2017, 08:28 - Spam: I'm in Mumbai till 16th, any chance of blade runner after? I'd definitely be up for it
04/10/2017, 13:31 - Nathan: I would like to invite you to the Doodle poll “Blade Runner 2”. Please follow the link - https://doodle.com/poll/u9smxmkttf5t3gg5

04/10/2017, 21:37 - John Begley: Basically the greatest song ever written
04/10/2017, 21:55 - John Begley: I think we should choreograph a music video for sci-fi night to this track
04/10/2017, 22:11 - Luke: You watched class of 99? 😤
04/10/2017, 22:15 - Olly: Can I be stop-motion-animated in the video?
04/10/2017, 22:23 - Luke: Was it as good as the blurb made out?
04/10/2017, 22:26 - John Begley: The song was
05/10/2017, 14:39 - James A: Turns out there's two other films in the series. 1999 was the middle one...
05/10/2017, 17:42 - Olly: Just imagine the songs on the first one!
08/10/2017, 15:37 - Luke: Seeing as there are 3 days with 3 different people for blade runner, any chance of adding Saturday and Sunday afternoon and evenings of that week to the doodle to see if that is any more successful?
08/10/2017, 16:00 - Nathan: I can't be arsed but I'm free Sunday afternoon.
08/10/2017, 16:26 - Luke: Me too
08/10/2017, 17:22 - Olly: 15th? Me to.

16/10/2017, 21:41 - Olly: It is definite sci fi material. I could stop watching them if it is to be shown at sci fi nights?
17/10/2017, 22:04 - Nathan: So, shall we go and see blade runner tomorrow?
17/10/2017, 22:09 - Olly: Yep. Where?
17/10/2017, 22:13 - Olly: Streatham would be best for me
17/10/2017, 22:14 - Nathan: I was going to suggest central

21/10/2017, 10:23 - John Begley: My phone works again
21/10/2017, 10:25 - Olly: You missed blade runner
21/10/2017, 10:26 - Olly: 2029
21/10/2017, 10:27 - John Begley: Sad
21/10/2017, 10:27 - John Begley: I was also doing a two day hangover though
21/10/2017, 10:27 - John Begley: I was able to leave the house
21/10/2017, 10:27 - Olly: I was also able to leave the house
25/10/2017, 07:44 - Olly: Sci fi or no sci fi? That is a question
25/10/2017, 07:52 - Nathan: Yeah, go on then.
25/10/2017, 07:54 - John Begley: I'm in
25/10/2017, 07:55 - Nathan: What time?

25/10/2017, 18:11 - James A: Pub or flat?
25/10/2017, 18:11 - Nathan: Pub
26/10/2017, 07:34 - Olly: Was my dinner free?
26/10/2017, 07:39 - Nathan: It may appear that way but it will cost you more than you can possibly imagine
26/10/2017, 07:40 - Olly: More than £7?!
26/10/2017, 08:04 - Luke: Here's almost exactly what Saturday will be like. Even the dodgy looking guy in the corner in the flat cap will be there again. Except hopefully my fight will be a bit more chilled.

29/10/2017, 20:58 - James A: Well done!
29/10/2017, 21:52 - Luke: Cheers! Yeh he was a bit bigger but my opponent just wandered off a half hr before we were meant to fight, so it was relatively nice of him to fight me :s
31/10/2017, 22:34 - Nathan: Sci-fi?

01/11/2017, 14:27 - Nathan: Instead of sci-fi?
01/11/2017, 14:28 - John Begley: No, someone just told me to watch them for pre ski lessons and I knew I'd forget it so I wrote it here so everyone can benefit
01/11/2017, 14:28 - Nathan: Thanks
01/11/2017, 14:28 - Nathan: See you at 5

15/11/2017, 18:19 - Spam: Pub or house ?
21/11/2017, 19:08 - Nathan: No Sci-fi tomorrow.
21/11/2017, 19:09 - Nathan: Or the week after.
21/11/2017, 19:09 - Nathan: Take a break. Enjoy yourselves.
21/11/2017, 20:18 - Olly: Not sure how I feel about enjoying myself next Wednesday. Nathan, want to do sci fi somewhere else? You're all invited to mine if you don't mind going to St Albans. 30 min from elephant& castle or Denmark hill?
21/11/2017, 20:27 - Nathan: I'm busy tomorrow then away the week after. Sci-fi night will return on the 6th.
21/11/2017, 20:30 - Olly: Ok. I will watch the original blade runner next week to keep me going. Let me know if anyone else wants to join

30/11/2017, 12:37 - Nathan: <Media omitted>
30/11/2017, 12:42 - Olly: I remember species, it was ace, although I didn't realise it was a retrospective comment on society at the time. I had assumed you'd already watched it on sci fi night? Had you not? How did this happen?!
30/11/2017, 12:43 - Olly: Original blade runner was frickin awesome by the way. Although 2019 had a better sound track.
30/11/2017, 12:46 - John Begley: I'm a computery guy
05/12/2017, 20:13 - Nathan: Sci-fi is on tomorrow.

05/12/2017, 21:17 - John Begley: Cool
05/12/2017, 21:31 - James A: I'm not going to be around for two weeks, will see you all on the 20th if it's on
05/12/2017, 21:51 - Luke: I'll come by before lectures
06/12/2017, 13:20 - John Begley: I can get there for 6
06/12/2017, 14:31 - Nathan: Me too.
06/12/2017, 14:32 - John Begley: Pub or house?
06/12/2017, 16:17 - Nathan: Dunno
06/12/2017, 17:17 - Olly: 620
06/12/2017, 17:24 - Olly: Pub?
06/12/2017, 17:25 - John Begley: I would like that
06/12/2017, 17:27 - Nathan: Yeah, ok
06/12/2017, 17:29 - John Begley: I will be early
06/12/2017, 17:32 - Olly: Why is it called a man-machine, even though it is a woman? Does that make Metropolis a feminist film?
06/12/2017, 17:32 - Olly: Answers by 620
06/12/2017, 17:48 - Luke: I think just having a woman is enough for femfi
11/12/2017, 10:27 - Nathan: Anyone wanna see Jacob Collier in Barcelona on Thursday night?
11/12/2017, 10:27 - John Begley: Are you actually going?
11/12/2017, 10:28 - Nathan: Seriously considering it
11/12/2017, 10:28 - Olly: Is Barcelona in camberwell?
11/12/2017, 10:29 - John Begley: I can't afford it, but Chris probably can and would
11/12/2017, 10:30 - Nathan: Ask him?
11/12/2017, 10:30 - John Begley: Just have
11/12/2017, 10:32 - Olly: Sounds like a pretty ace adventure, but I can't go, and to my detriment I don't actually know who he is
11/12/2017, 10:33 - John Begley: Crazy jazz I'm not clever enough to enjoy
11/12/2017, 10:37 - John Begley: He can't go this week
11/12/2017, 11:00 - Nathan: Ask again! It's a once (twice) in a lifetime experience.
11/12/2017, 11:14 - John Begley: Haha
11/12/2017, 11:17 - Olly: Maybe get there a couple of days before and hang out at a jazz bar in Barcelona - find some jazzites to go with? May or may not work, but it'll be an adventure?
12/12/2017, 20:18 - Olly: Is there a sci fi tomorrow, or are you on the beach inn Barcelona?
12/12/2017, 20:18 - Olly: *in
12/12/2017, 20:47 - Nathan: Sci-fi tomorrow.
12/12/2017, 20:49 - Olly: Cool
13/12/2017, 10:47 - Nathan: Anyone else? If not, shall we do something fun instead, Olly?
13/12/2017, 10:48 - Luke: I may be up for Scifi/ something tonight. It's the last lecture, but she's been pretty rubbish so think I'll just skip it.
13/12/2017, 11:32 - Spam: I'm up for sci-fi, sorry to spoil your potential fun night
13/12/2017, 11:33 - Nathan: Damnit. Ok, sci-fi night it is.
13/12/2017, 11:50 - John Begley: I have food poisoning
13/12/2017, 11:51 - John Begley: Terrible squirty tail at the moment
13/12/2017, 11:52 - Luke: What was the responsible food?
13/12/2017, 12:28 - Olly: So is it decided that fun is it of the question?
13/12/2017, 12:28 - Olly: (For John it is I guess)
13/12/2017, 13:01 - John Begley: Haha. It was a Leon Christmas wrap I think. Turkey, ham and stuffing
13/12/2017, 14:17 - James A: My sympathies. Have come a cropper from Leon wraps before as well. Put me off for a while but back on them now. Bit like a posh Morley's, if I ate Morley's.
13/12/2017, 14:20 - Nathan: I'm gonna have to try one of these.
13/12/2017, 14:20 - Nathan: Looks like fun is off, yeah. So see you in the pub from 6?

13/12/2017, 18:12 - Nathan: Yep. Be there in 5
13/12/2017, 18:14 - Luke: 5 too
14/12/2017, 13:13 - Olly: What did I miss?
14/12/2017, 13:15 - Nathan: Two jetliners colliding
14/12/2017, 13:17 - Olly: A goodn?
14/12/2017, 13:22 - Nathan: Actually great!
14/12/2017, 16:44 - Olly: What's it called again? I've got homework
14/12/2017, 16:44 - Nathan: Millennium
14/12/2017, 17:01 - Olly: Was Robby Williams a good actor afterall?
14/12/2017, 17:15 - Luke: Maybe that's who the man in the robot suit was
18/12/2017, 11:00 - Olly: It's worth a little watch of what was missed in Barcelona:
18/12/2017, 11:00 - Olly: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=5FRMLt4qPvk
18/12/2017, 11:03 - Olly: I don't understand how the instruments know when/when not to loop! Does he have special signs the computer recognises, or has he pre-programmed the pattern of looping?
18/12/2017, 11:14 - Nathan: I think the songs are pre-sequenced, with the patterns awaiting recording inputs from their respective instruments which have bespoke triggers, e.g. a slide up on the bass or a kick+crash on the kit. But who really knows?
18/12/2017, 11:15 - Olly: It's clever. Have you seen yourself in the audience yet?
18/12/2017, 11:17 - Nathan: I haven't watched it.
18/12/2017, 12:49 - Olly: I must admit I do like it. However, personally I feel he needs to smoke for another 35years before he'll have a voice that I'll fully get on with
20/12/2017, 09:10 - Olly: Is there sci fi?
20/12/2017, 09:11 - John Begley: Not for me. Work Christmas do I'm afraid
20/12/2017, 09:21 - Nathan: Not sure. Kind of ill. Is there much demand?
20/12/2017, 09:29 - Olly: I'm at a loose end from about 2pm today

20/12/2017, 11:52 - Nathan: Alright. Sci-fi night is on. But let's keep it low volume.
20/12/2017, 12:43 - Olly: Cool. What time shall I come over?

03/01/2018, 06:58 - Olly: So you think all this typing is waking Sam up?
03/01/2018, 06:58 - John Begley: If you like I will call you 'friend'
03/01/2018, 06:58 - Olly: Inbetweeners 'Special friend'

07/01/2018, 20:37 - Olly: My favourite radio DJ stay macaroni mentioned a newish (paybacks independent/obscure) sci fi film with a weird but excellent soundtrack, called 'the white King'.
07/01/2018, 20:54 - Luke: "This sad mess of a vaguely sci-fi coming-of-age tale seemingly could not be more plugged into current fears, and yet it feels utterly irrelevant" - sounds perfect!
07/01/2018, 20:58 - Olly: He only said the soundtrack was good (and the bit I heard did sound good). As long as it has less than 10/100 rotten toms, it'll be fine
07/01/2018, 20:58 - Luke: It's RT score is an impressive 72
07/01/2018, 20:59 - Luke: But from a grand 17 votes
07/01/2018, 21:02 - Olly: Btw Luke, I was going to watch your camberwell film. However I noticed it was more than 5 minutes. Is it worth a full 30min viewing? There is no 1.4x speed option on whatsapp
07/01/2018, 21:08 - Luke: Lol. Yeh it's a 1960s documentary so it really could do with speeding up. I enjoyed it but I also had nothing better to do when I watched it
09/01/2018, 20:24 - Nathan: Sci-fi tomorrow?
09/01/2018, 20:24 - Olly: Yes
10/01/2018, 10:43 - James A: Yep
10/01/2018, 15:05 - John Begley: Yes
10/01/2018, 15:05 - John Begley: 5:30
10/01/2018, 16:06 - Nathan: Yeeeep
10/01/2018, 17:40 - Olly: Delays... Be there at 645
10/01/2018, 17:41 - Spam: 6.15 myself
10/01/2018, 17:52 - Nathan: Are you here John?
10/01/2018, 17:52 - John Begley: Nearly
10/01/2018, 18:00 - Spam: Pub or what?
10/01/2018, 18:01 - John Begley: What from me. I'm starving and not drinking
10/01/2018, 18:17 - John Begley: I lost. We are in the pub
12/01/2018, 06:59 - Luke: What did you watch? Worth catching up?
12/01/2018, 07:02 - John Begley: Strange days
12/01/2018, 07:02 - John Begley: Only half of it though as it's over 2 hours long
12/01/2018, 07:03 - Olly: First half was great!
12/01/2018, 07:04 - Luke: Hmmm, even with Oli's review the length is off putting
12/01/2018, 07:04 - Olly: Quite feminist
12/01/2018, 07:05 - Luke: Nice.
12/01/2018, 07:11 - Olly: My last comment was of course, a lie.
12/01/2018, 07:12 - Olly: But it did have superconducting quantum interference devices
12/01/2018, 07:12 - John Begley: And feminist boobs
12/01/2018, 07:13 - Olly: Both of which are good
12/01/2018, 07:13 - Luke: I obviously thought that, but then read a summary and it had a female bodyguard side kick? Which did sound like enough for femfi..... Aw well
12/01/2018, 07:14 - John Begley: In all seriousness it is quite shit, but in terms of enjoyabilty for a sci-fi night film, I'd say it was in the top ten per cent
12/01/2018, 07:15 - Olly: Anything could happen in the second half of the film
12/01/2018, 08:50 - Nathan: Only one thing is guaranteed: Excellent leather trousers.
12/01/2018, 16:07 - Spam: Have you got yourself a pair yet?
12/01/2018, 16:59 - Luke: Just had this pop us as an individual notification on my phone and thought Sam was having a go at me for not being manly enough
12/01/2018, 17:00 - John Begley: Hahaha
14/01/2018, 14:58 - Olly: Did you finish strange days last sci fi night? Or is next week going to be part 2? (Otherwise I was going to catch up/finish it today)
14/01/2018, 14:59 - Spam: We did not finish it, I think you need you need to watch about 15-20mins, then stop!
14/01/2018, 15:05 - Olly: That can be done... Do you know the exact time at which you stopped it? (It's unnecessary of course, but it is sci fi night. In factt why not get some meteorology involved)
14/01/2018, 15:07 - Spam: Meteorology??
14/01/2018, 15:09 - Olly: Stupid swipe. Metrology

16/01/2018, 08:08 - Olly: I'm hiking that weekend. Have fun
16/01/2018, 08:21 - John Begley: I might be moving house so should probably keep it free just in case
16/01/2018, 08:28 - Nathan: ?
16/01/2018, 21:01 - Nathan: Sci-fi tomorrow?
16/01/2018, 21:02 - Olly: Yes! And it's cheese on toast day! Woohoo
16/01/2018, 21:31 - John Begley: Yes
16/01/2018, 21:31 - John Begley: Stop inviting
16/01/2018, 21:38 - Olly: You asking Nathan to stop inviting you, John?
16/01/2018, 21:39 - Olly: Or just to be less inviting, in general
16/01/2018, 21:44 - Spam: Yes definitely
16/01/2018, 21:44 - Spam: To coming
16/01/2018, 21:45 - Spam: Now I know I need to reply to these fast
16/01/2018, 22:33 - John Begley: Haha
16/01/2018, 22:33 - John Begley: No I like how hospitable he is in general, but I like it to end here, within this group
16/01/2018, 22:33 - John Begley: Although I do like cesar
16/01/2018, 22:33 - John Begley: What a guy
16/01/2018, 23:40 - Luke: Omg! The brass band night looks ace! I'll see whether I can put aside my deep hatred of the bussey building 😡
21/01/2018, 16:12 - Olly: I saw some excellent dusting on the star-wars  baddie's ship

27/01/2018, 08:49 - John Begley: Some more squat art
27/01/2018, 09:09 - Nathan: To drain the swamp of men-only clubs there must be a public register

27/01/2018, 09:09 - Nathan: I'm a bit worried about sci-fi night
27/01/2018, 09:57 - Luke: Lol. Do you not want your flat listed as the HQ of a men only Scifi night?
27/01/2018, 10:41 - Nathan: It's just more admin...
27/01/2018, 10:47 - Olly: " Today these clubs, whose entry is still strictly controlled by the black ball, continue to honour some of their very un-PC traditions."
27/01/2018, 10:47 - Olly: Do you have a black ball?
27/01/2018, 10:48 - Olly: If not, perhaps sci fi night is exempt?
30/01/2018, 22:15 - Olly: I have a new phone...  Can you see me?  I wouldnt have got messages today. Anything interesting I've missed?
30/01/2018, 23:25 - Nathan: It's been nuts. What a day!
30/01/2018, 23:25 - Nathan: Sci-fi?
31/01/2018, 07:30 - James A: Can't do this week (again), away in Sweden
31/01/2018, 07:31 - Olly: Yep
31/01/2018, 07:35 - Nathan: Schnergen

31/01/2018, 16:07 - Olly: BTW, it is obligatory pub for sci fi tonight I'm afraid - I've had good family news
31/01/2018, 17:08 - Olly: Be there 6ish
31/01/2018, 17:09 - John Begley: Are you going to be a father?
31/01/2018, 17:10 - Nathan: Me too
31/01/2018, 17:10 - Nathan: For 6ish that is...
31/01/2018, 17:10 - John Begley: Haha
31/01/2018, 17:11 - Olly: To be a father for 6 I've got some work to do
31/01/2018, 17:11 - John Begley: You can do it
02/02/2018, 23:24 - John Begley: G. O. R. A - for the list
02/02/2018, 23:58 - Luke: 👍
03/02/2018, 18:06 - Olly: If there are any other hippy-sci-fyers out there, or if you just really like glitter and hug-learning-workshops, join me at shambala festival on Aug bank holiday (especially seeing as there is no supernormal this summer!)
03/02/2018, 18:06 - Olly: This message was deleted

03/02/2018, 18:07 - John Begley: Yeah
03/02/2018, 18:09 - Olly: (I may have posted the wrong link first, and tried to delete it. If you see two, the second one is the right one)
03/02/2018, 18:11 - Olly: It's Nick Vs favorite festival. Money-permitting he is hopefully coming...
03/02/2018, 18:22 - Olly: John: is it the glitter or hug-workshops that does it for you?
03/02/2018, 18:23 - John Begley: Just completely trusted your judgement. Didn't even check the site
03/02/2018, 18:23 - John Begley: Will do though
04/02/2018, 09:52 - Nathan: What's the music like?
04/02/2018, 13:46 - Olly: Last time I went we danced a lot, a fair bit of electronica, but overall no particular theme, except perhaps a theme of 'inclusivity' and fun.
04/02/2018, 13:47 - Olly: There was a fair bit of techno late at night, we did some drum and bass aerobics, there was weird arty/world music, bit of the usual baltic beats and hippy stuff, and Nick and I (along with 3 other strangers) got up on stage and did an interpretive dance-off in front of a hundred or so people - I of course wearing a top hat and a tutu at the time. I think buckfast had been imbibed prior to that point.
04/02/2018, 14:32 - Nathan: Sound great. I'm tentatively in. Will confirm in a week or two.
04/02/2018, 14:33 - Olly: Awesome
04/02/2018, 14:36 - Olly: If/when you do book, get the ticket including return coach from London (Thurs morning coach)
06/02/2018, 21:02 - Nathan: Sci-fi?
06/02/2018, 21:11 - Olly: Yes I do

06/02/2018, 23:14 - Spam: Yes pls
07/02/2018, 08:05 - James A: Yep probably
07/02/2018, 16:17 - John Begley: From what time?
07/02/2018, 16:33 - Nathan: Now
07/02/2018, 16:45 - John Begley: Home or pub
07/02/2018, 16:45 - Nathan: Hmm
07/02/2018, 16:45 - Nathan: Pub?
07/02/2018, 16:46 - John Begley: OK. Just getting a quick double cheesburger
07/02/2018, 16:47 - Nathan: Cool, I'll head down.
07/02/2018, 16:49 - John Begley: Mines a pint of some beer
07/02/2018, 16:51 - Nathan: I'll see what I can do
07/02/2018, 17:50 - Spam: Pub I assume
07/02/2018, 17:50 - Nathan: Assume makes an ass
07/02/2018, 17:50 - Nathan: But in this case, correct.
08/02/2018, 09:28 - Spam: My stomach is in a grim state today, I think the jalapeño plan as backfired
08/02/2018, 09:32 - John Begley: Same
08/02/2018, 09:33 - Nathan: Same, and I didn't even eat any.
08/02/2018, 09:33 - John Begley: Rancid salami
08/02/2018, 09:33 - Nathan: Good band name
08/02/2018, 09:34 - John Begley: Ha
08/02/2018, 09:42 - Olly: Sounds like you caught my bug. I was very ill last night, along with ten other people from work. So it can't have been the pizza. I'm feeling much better today though. Apologies!
08/02/2018, 21:05 - Olly: Did you guys get seriously ill? I was very sick on train and when I got home. I'm off work today, still rough. I hope you guys aren't too bad. Sharing pizza can be a bad idea.
08/02/2018, 21:10 - John Begley: Not been puking just a bit of ring sting and gut rot
08/02/2018, 22:00 - Nathan: Been fine. Just had a lovely pizza with no jalapeños.
09/02/2018, 07:06 - Olly: Well I'm glad I've not made you all diseased
09/02/2018, 07:07 - John Begley: Got some time off work though didn't you. So thats good
09/02/2018, 07:49 - Olly: I guess, but not being able to sleep because of the stomach cramps sort of spoiled the novelty of the time off work!
12/02/2018, 18:39 - Nathan: Anyone going/wanting to go to Field Day festival?
14/02/2018, 13:45 - Nathan: Sci-fi?
14/02/2018, 13:46 - Olly: Can't do today I'm afraid
14/02/2018, 14:00 - James A: Not about this evening, sorry
14/02/2018, 14:01 - John Begley: Same.
14/02/2018, 16:42 - Nathan: The end of an era.
14/02/2018, 16:43 - Spam: Yeah I'm also out, sci-fi night couldn't last forever
14/02/2018, 16:56 - John Begley: I'm not sure three weeks is an 'era'
14/02/2018, 17:16 - Olly: It's spelt 'error'
14/02/2018, 17:19 - Olly: I vote [Nathan goes to] shit pizza
14/02/2018, 17:19 - Olly: With extra jalapenos

14/02/2018, 17:26 - John Begley: Moloko
14/02/2018, 17:34 - Luke: Noodle city
14/02/2018, 17:35 - Nathan: Ahhhh, the onion rings.
18/02/2018, 13:24 - Olly: I'm potentially up for field day festival. I'm guessing it's not a camping one right? I recognise some of the djs - jazzy electronica theme right? But I don't know many bands. Is there a music theme?
18/02/2018, 13:46 - Nathan: I don't know many bands either. But yeah, seems jazz/soul/electronica oriented. And yeah, no camping.
18/02/2018, 14:03 - Olly: Would you go to one day, or both?
18/02/2018, 14:05 - Nathan: I'm going both days.
18/02/2018, 14:14 - Olly: Have you purchased?
18/02/2018, 14:15 - Olly: I've got an idea for some wearable tech I might make...
18/02/2018, 14:32 - Nathan: Yep, I have purchased. For me and John Hopkins. Some from work going to.
18/02/2018, 14:33 - Nathan: Got my Shambala ticket too.
18/02/2018, 14:33 - Nathan: Very excited about your wearable tech.
18/02/2018, 14:34 - John Begley: Don't think I can afford it
18/02/2018, 14:34 - Nathan: Come for a day?
18/02/2018, 14:39 - Nathan: Its only £40 or something
19/02/2018, 11:04 - Olly: Great news you are coming to shambala. There is quite a crew going now.
19/02/2018, 11:05 - Olly: I will look into purchasing field day tickets later in week
19/02/2018, 12:54 - Olly: If band-fi needs a dirge instrument, the synth is now boxed up, mobile, and fully functioning (with enough functionality to make some good sounds, but not the full set just yet)
19/02/2018, 12:58 - John Begley: Good work, send a video of it inaction
19/02/2018, 12:59 - Olly: Like an audition?
19/02/2018, 13:02 - Olly: The phone video won't do the sound compete justice (it'll possibly make it sound better?), but I should be able to do one. Might have time to do it tonight...
21/02/2018, 08:02 - Spam: Is sci fi on?
21/02/2018, 08:02 - Nathan: Yeah, let's do it.

21/02/2018, 08:31 - James A: I'm in
21/02/2018, 09:29 - Olly: Dont think I'll be able to make it today
21/02/2018, 16:14 - Nathan: What time?
21/02/2018, 16:14 - John Begley: 6ish
21/02/2018, 17:57 - James A: On the bus

21/02/2018, 21:42 - Nathan: I've just burnt all my records. Music starts now.
21/02/2018, 21:42 - Olly: I can fit it in if I don't bring anything else at all with me. Who needs ski gear
21/02/2018, 21:47 - Olly: So I passed the audition? I'm in the imaginary sci fi band? I fully expect the sounds genated here goes with whatever genre the band is.
21/02/2018, 21:48 - John Begley: At the moment I think you are lead synth
21/02/2018, 21:48 - John Begley: I'm not sure I can play an instrument, and I haven't invented one yet
21/02/2018, 21:49 - Olly: The band could have two drummers and a very difficult to use synth
21/02/2018, 21:49 - Luke: What film deserved 30x ?
21/02/2018, 21:50 - Olly: Plus James is bass

21/02/2018, 21:51 - Spam: Foreign dogshit
21/02/2018, 21:52 - Olly: Does that mean there is the possibility of a good film on at least once of the 8 evenings of ski fi?
21/02/2018, 21:53 - Olly: Or was it likely the best of the dregs
21/02/2018, 21:53 - Spam: I think all that remains is gold
21/02/2018, 21:54 - John Begley: The fountain

01/03/2018, 11:42 - Nathan: It's too sunny to be cold
01/03/2018, 12:52 - Olly: The snow is just ludicrously yum
04/03/2018, 19:58 - John Begley: Hairy daughter

14/03/2018, 12:25 - Olly: I should be able to come earlier than usual, e.g. 530

15/03/2018, 16:17 - Nathan: Just forgot
18/03/2018, 20:06 - Olly: Just finished dark city. That was a excellently sci fi ending!
21/03/2018, 09:47 - Nathan: Sci-fi?
21/03/2018, 10:33 - John Begley: Yes
21/03/2018, 11:23 - James A: Yep
21/03/2018, 13:21 - Olly: Not today im afraid
21/03/2018, 14:26 - Spam: Most likely
21/03/2018, 14:27 - Nathan: What time?
21/03/2018, 14:31 - John Begley: I'm leaving here at 4
21/03/2018, 14:31 - John Begley: So 4.35
21/03/2018, 14:31 - Nathan: Ok.

21/03/2018, 21:59 - Nathan: Err, wtf?
21/03/2018, 21:59 - Spam: It was really weird, she was screaming, I thought she's been hit by a car
21/03/2018, 21:59 - Nathan: Where is she?
21/03/2018, 22:00 - Spam: Basically outside your flat just now
21/03/2018, 22:00 - Spam: Someone was calling an ambulance, they're we're loads of people out on the road around her
21/03/2018, 22:00 - Spam: Then an ambulance I thought was arriving just went past
21/03/2018, 22:01 - Nathan: There's nothing outside now
21/03/2018, 22:01 - Spam: And then she got up, she seemed in hysterics, but was also more concerned about where her bag was ...
21/03/2018, 22:01 - Spam: No real idea what happened
21/03/2018, 22:01 - Spam: Maybe she got hit but not that badly
21/03/2018, 22:10 - James A: Fuck no I didn't see that, did you leave long after me?
21/03/2018, 22:11 - Spam: About 2-3 mins
21/03/2018, 22:11 - John Begley: I mugged a lady and threw her on the floor, could be that?
21/03/2018, 22:12 - Spam: Ah that makes a lot of sense
21/03/2018, 22:12 - John Begley: Mystery over

21/03/2018, 22:12 - John Begley: Haha
21/03/2018, 22:13 - John Begley: In all seriousness, was she a crazy person? Did Nathan not see her?
21/03/2018, 22:14 - Spam: I'm genuinely not sure if she got hit by a car or a crazy person, but it looked more like an accident if I had to guess
21/03/2018, 22:16 - Nathan: There was nothing gonig on outside at all. I think you probably refracted it all.
22/03/2018, 08:31 - Olly: Classic Sam, barely a day goes by without him refracting some wavelength or other
22/03/2018, 09:58 - Olly: What film did you watch?
22/03/2018, 11:58 - Nathan: Annihilation
22/03/2018, 11:59 - Spam: Genuinely good film
22/03/2018, 12:20 - Olly: I certainly don't remember a film with that name on the list... Were you cheating?
22/03/2018, 12:21 - Spam: The list is dead
22/03/2018, 12:22 - Olly: I'm away for one week, and see what happens... All tradition out of the window. Such irreverence
22/03/2018, 12:23 - Spam: We invoked an age old sci fi night rule, when they're is a unanimous food vote tie, then the list can be ignored
22/03/2018, 12:24 - Olly: That's absolutely ok then. A fine tradition indeed.
22/03/2018, 12:26 - Luke: Good to see the bureaucracy ticking over👌
22/03/2018, 12:35 - Olly: He's back with a phone!
28/03/2018, 09:58 - Olly: Is there sci fi today?
28/03/2018, 09:59 - Nathan: Yeah?
28/03/2018, 09:59 - Olly: Yeah
28/03/2018, 10:00 - John Begley: Moving house
28/03/2018, 10:01 - Nathan: Keep your back straight
28/03/2018, 10:02 - John Begley: Get you leg up
28/03/2018, 10:54 - James A: Got a work thing, hope house move goes well
28/03/2018, 12:46 - Nathan: Ok. No sci-fi night. Sorry Olly.
28/03/2018, 13:07 - Olly: Ok
28/03/2018, 13:37 - Spam: Really no sci fi?
28/03/2018, 13:37 - Spam: I’m in I think
28/03/2018, 13:37 - Spam: But then again I’m not that enthusiastic
28/03/2018, 14:04 - Nathan: It's Yi's viva...
28/03/2018, 14:17 - Spam: Fair enough
28/03/2018, 14:17 - Spam: Say ‘well done’ from me
28/03/2018, 16:10 - Olly: Are you saying with the quotes in? Perhaps with gestures for emphasis?
28/03/2018, 21:38 - Nathan: I tried it with and without the quotes. No response.
28/03/2018, 22:25 - Olly: Annihilation was kinda feminist road side picnic
28/03/2018, 22:28 - Olly: (Possibly the only feminist sci fi film?)
29/03/2018, 11:35 - Luke: <Media omitted>
29/03/2018, 11:36 - Nathan: oh wow
29/03/2018, 12:11 - James A: Is that Forest Hill?!
29/03/2018, 12:55 - Luke: Yep, it's Forest Hill
29/03/2018, 12:56 - Luke: I was almost tempted to stop for lunch but it was abit too early
29/03/2018, 16:54 - John Begley: Hahahahaha
29/03/2018, 16:54 - John Begley: Love that
29/03/2018, 16:54 - John Begley: Absolutely ferfect
29/03/2018, 17:40 - Nathan: also, shit pizza has rebranded itself as 'Organica'
29/03/2018, 17:42 - Nathan: also also, only just realized chickens dont have fur
29/03/2018, 19:37 - Luke: Yeh I don't think they were going for a pun. Just going for the letter that looked most like a 'p'
29/03/2018, 19:38 - Luke: Yeh saw that! Have you tried the new improved 💩🍕?
29/03/2018, 19:40 - Nathan: why not actually use a 'p'?
29/03/2018, 19:41 - Nathan: I haven't tried Organica yet, but I've looked in and can confirm it really is only a rebranding. Same old shit pizza guaranteed. But organic, obviously.
29/03/2018, 19:41 - Luke: Copyrigt? Because the F was on a raised block I think they did have a P at one point
29/03/2018, 19:41 - Luke: Sounds great!
29/03/2018, 19:42 - Luke: A rebranding is just what it needed
29/03/2018, 19:43 - Nathan: hopefully they'll have taken the opportunity to stock up on organic jalepenos.
29/03/2018, 20:07 - Luke: Lol
29/03/2018, 21:43 - John Begley: Ferfect. Still pissing myself about that one.
29/03/2018, 21:43 - John Begley: Not a word, doesn't look like perfect, and sound vaguely horrific. Terrible choice.
29/03/2018, 21:44 - John Begley: Looks like a different font size too
04/04/2018, 10:24 - Nathan: Sorry, no sci-fi.
04/04/2018, 10:52 - Luke: Shame, I could make it tonight too!
04/04/2018, 11:01 - Nathan: It's Philpots' viva. He loves sci-fi. You should all come.
04/04/2018, 11:02 - Olly: But I don't know the song
04/04/2018, 15:41 - Luke: Has demon seed featured on sci-fi night? Because someone just mentioned it to me and it sounds like perfect sci-fi night content
04/04/2018, 15:42 - John Begley: First volume classic I'm afraid
04/04/2018, 15:43 - Luke: They're volumes not seasons now?
04/04/2018, 15:44 - John Begley: Refer to the poster
04/04/2018, 16:12 - Nathan: Don't worry. There will be another chance to watch it at the end of season 10 in the second great sci-fi film vote before the second Slurry Sunday.
04/04/2018, 17:04 - Luke: Omg, we totally need a second great sci-fi film vote! Though we'll probably just end up watching that romcom again
10/04/2018, 17:04 - Nathan: Sci-fi tomorrow?
10/04/2018, 17:49 - Olly: Cannie do tomorrow
10/04/2018, 18:07 - Luke: I'm up for it

30/05/2018, 17:05 - Spam: Is it worth it ?
30/05/2018, 17:07 - Nathan: Maybe not. Unless you're bringing some amazing conversation.
30/05/2018, 17:08 - Spam: I’ve got nothing
30/05/2018, 17:08 - Nathan: Me neither.
30/05/2018, 17:08 - Spam: Won’t be coming next week though
30/05/2018, 17:09 - Nathan: I will
30/05/2018, 17:16 - Nathan: I'm still gonna vote and watch a film. Maybe one of the long ones.
30/05/2018, 17:17 - Spam: I hope you’ll head out to Nandos for a lonely dinner as well
30/05/2018, 17:18 - Nathan: Probably Morley's. Should be a quick food vote at least.
30/05/2018, 17:19 - Luke: Lol, see you all in 2 weeks then 👋
03/06/2018, 20:23 - John Begley: Everyone here is invited to my stag do. Can you let me know if you can come. Ta
03/06/2018, 20:56 - Luke: Yeh I'll be there!
03/06/2018, 21:18 - John Begley: Cool, feel free to say that in the stag WhatsApp group so a) I can count up who is coming easily and b) I dont look like a loser
03/06/2018, 21:20 - Luke: Lol will do, just it was very bantery and didn't feel a simple 'I'll be there' would cut it
03/06/2018, 21:46 - John Begley: Hahaha, thanks. No one coming is bantery, but I think stag dos make some people pretend they are. I'll try to police it...
04/06/2018, 11:19 - John Begley: By the way, for those monitoring the stag group, Sam was invited by mistake. It was meant to be the mackerel and instead I invited sameen, my mates little brother who I haven't seen in years. He is too enthusiastic to kick out now, but please don't take him to be the general quality on my friends.
05/06/2018, 15:58 - Spam: Hey, sorry I can’t make it that weekend, at a festival. But really glad to hear Sameen will fill void
05/06/2018, 15:59 - John Begley: Shame. You are the preferred Sam.
05/06/2018, 18:02 - Nathan: Sci-fi tomorrow?

06/06/2018, 16:21 - Nathan: Beers on the Green?
06/06/2018, 18:41 - Olly: Getting closer finally. Where are you guys - green, pub, house?
06/06/2018, 19:48 - Luke: You still on the green?
06/06/2018, 19:49 - Nathan: Bolu
13/06/2018, 06:35 - John Begley: Sci-fi?
13/06/2018, 07:08 - Nathan: Yep
13/06/2018, 07:14 - James A: Can’t do this evening, at a food festival. Hopefully Bolu will be there.
13/06/2018, 08:15 - Luke: I've booked into a muay Thai seminar tonight so can't come, will be back next week

13/06/2018, 17:31 - John Begley: Are you fucking joking?
13/06/2018, 17:32 - John Begley: Can we vote now?
13/06/2018, 17:33 - John Begley: Nathan and I, both vote wuli wuli.
13/06/2018, 17:33 - Spam: What is that?
13/06/2018, 17:37 - Spam: Looked it up, sounds horrific
13/06/2018, 17:49 - John Begley: You still have a vote
13/06/2018, 17:49 - John Begley: Doesn't count though
13/06/2018, 17:49 - Spam: Not a v meaningful one

20/06/2018, 07:49 - Luke: Is sci-fi on tonight?
20/06/2018, 08:21 - Nathan: Sci-fi is not on. It's just not on. Sorry. Feel free to use my place for a get together. I'll leave the window open.
20/06/2018, 08:24 - Luke: Lol. No worries.

26/06/2018, 14:36 - Spam: Is sci-fi / football-fi night happening tomorrow ?
26/06/2018, 14:37 - Olly: I'll come if football-fi truly has zero football as the 'fi' suggests
26/06/2018, 14:38 - John Begley: Football-non-fi
26/06/2018, 14:39 - Spam: Ie non fiction football
26/06/2018, 14:39 - Spam: Real football
26/06/2018, 14:41 - John Begley: Oui
26/06/2018, 17:17 - Nathan: Yeah! You want it at mine?
26/06/2018, 18:07 - Olly: Have fun! Maybe see you guys next week
26/06/2018, 18:44 - John Begley: Oli, it will manly just be beers with the TV on, talking and not looking at the TV are allowed
26/06/2018, 18:55 - Olly: I hate football just too much I'm afraid. (Plus I've got work to do anyway on my wearable tech for shambala)
27/06/2018, 13:03 - Luke: So are we doing football in Camberwell tonight? I'll be about from 5.45
27/06/2018, 13:12 - Spam: I’m not coming in afriad, despite initially asking
27/06/2018, 13:12 - Spam: *im
27/06/2018, 14:59 - John Begley: What time does it begin?
27/06/2018, 15:25 - Nathan: I'm gonna leave work nowish. Back by 1630
27/06/2018, 15:45 - John Begley: Same
27/06/2018, 16:32 - John Begley: On the green?
27/06/2018, 16:36 - Nathan: Home.
27/06/2018, 16:36 - John Begley: But I'm sunbathing on the green now
27/06/2018, 16:37 - John Begley: Beer on the green
27/06/2018, 16:38 - Nathan: Ok. See you in 15
27/06/2018, 16:39 - John Begley: Get beer
27/06/2018, 17:02 - John Begley: You still coming?
27/06/2018, 17:02 - John Begley: I'm parched
27/06/2018, 17:03 - Nathan: Yeah. Now
27/06/2018, 17:31 - Luke: You in green still
04/07/2018, 09:12 - Nathan: Sci-fi?
04/07/2018, 09:31 - John Begley: Can't tonighr
04/07/2018, 10:59 - James A: Yeah I can’t either I’m afraid
04/07/2018, 11:15 - Spam: Same
04/07/2018, 11:34 - Olly: "   "
04/07/2018, 11:45 - Nathan: This is shaping up to be a true classic
04/07/2018, 11:50 - John Begley: Hahaha
04/07/2018, 14:11 - Luke: Yeh sorry, not going to make it either
10/07/2018, 11:59 - Nathan: Who's around tomorrow? Pub or Flat?
10/07/2018, 12:00 - Spam: Good night for sci-fi, nothing else on
10/07/2018, 12:14 - John Begley: What was the rising sun like for football?
10/07/2018, 12:18 - Spam: Packed, good atmosphere on penalties
10/07/2018, 12:19 - Spam: Waiting on this ballot today
10/07/2018, 12:19 - Spam: But I think it’s really unlikely
10/07/2018, 12:19 - Spam: I’d like to see the game at an outdoor screen somewhere though
10/07/2018, 12:21 - Nathan: Yeah, I like the sound of outdoor.
10/07/2018, 12:23 - Nathan: Hyde park?
10/07/2018, 12:23 - Spam: That was what the ballot was for
10/07/2018, 12:36 - Nathan: Can't really see any other decent options.
10/07/2018, 12:45 - Spam: But... did you enter the ballot?
10/07/2018, 12:46 - Nathan: Nope!
10/07/2018, 12:48 - Spam: That is a problem
10/07/2018, 13:58 - Luke: This place is outdoor https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/watch-world-cup-estate-in-action-in-clash-with-belgium/
10/07/2018, 13:59 - Luke: Also the Peckham car park bar place is apparently showing it.
10/07/2018, 14:00 - Luke: Personally up for your flat as pubs are just going to be rammed, but will go with whatever as long as it is in South London
11/07/2018, 09:13 - Nathan: Ok. Weather is too shit to prioritise outdoor viewing. Could try a few pubs in Camberwell with my flat as a backup?
11/07/2018, 09:23 - John Begley: Looks like it will be sunny from 3 onwards
11/07/2018, 09:25 - Nathan: I've got sunny after 8...
11/07/2018, 09:26 - John Begley: Same here. But also after 3
11/07/2018, 09:27 - Nathan: So are you voting for Kirby Estate?
11/07/2018, 09:28 - John Begley: It is good?
11/07/2018, 09:28 - John Begley: The screen looks quite small
11/07/2018, 09:28 - John Begley: Will we be allowed in if we don't live on the estate?
11/07/2018, 09:29 - John Begley: Will they stab us if they find out we don't?
11/07/2018, 09:41 - Nathan: Agreed about the small screen. So then it's Frank's car park bar or persuading the mackerel to give us his ballot tickets for Hyde park.
11/07/2018, 09:44 - John Begley: Haha, Chris is going the Prince of Peckham. But that sounds like it will be ramo
11/07/2018, 09:48 - John Begley: Can we sneak our own beer into Frank's?
11/07/2018, 10:17 - Luke: I'm up for your idea of trying pubs in Camberwell, then if they're shit/rammed we have your flat as back up

Also Kirby estate suggestion was a bit of a joke, it looks like mainly kids watching it in a car park
11/07/2018, 14:08 - Luke: What's the plan?
11/07/2018, 14:43 - Nathan: Camberwell pubs?
11/07/2018, 14:50 - Luke: I'm up for it. Will be in Camberwell at 5.37
11/07/2018, 15:06 - John Begley: Will be in camberwell at 5
11/07/2018, 16:29 - Olly: Sci fi is dead
11/07/2018, 16:35 - John Begley: Semi-fi-fi is very much alive
11/07/2018, 17:33 - Nathan: Hermit's cave
18/07/2018, 08:00 - Nathan: Sci-fi?
18/07/2018, 08:11 - John Begley: Not for me tonight
18/07/2018, 08:18 - Luke: Yeh I'm up for it
18/07/2018, 09:50 - James A: No can do
18/07/2018, 10:55 - Spam: I also can’t make it
18/07/2018, 10:58 - Nathan: Alright. Think I might take this opportunity to do some work instead then. Next sci-fi night, 15th August.
18/07/2018, 10:58 - Luke: 👌
18/07/2018, 12:32 - Olly: 15th aug is in my diary
30/07/2018, 08:45 - Spam: Has The Endless ever been watched? Watched it last night and it was good by sfn standards, recommend adding to the list if we ever go beyond current one
14/08/2018, 19:27 - Luke: Is sci-fi still happening tomorrow?
14/08/2018, 19:35 - Nathan: Good question. Might not be a great idea. Been pretty feverish the last couple of days.
14/08/2018, 19:40 - Luke: Shit! Is this the illness you were holding off for the holiday, or something you got out there?
14/08/2018, 20:02 - Nathan: Not sure
14/08/2018, 20:31 - Olly: Oh no! Take care
15/08/2018, 07:49 - James A: Sorry to hear that, get well soon Nathan
22/08/2018, 11:46 - John Begley: Sci-fi?
22/08/2018, 12:42 - Olly: Pack-fi
22/08/2018, 12:46 - Nathan: Yeah, pack-fi
22/08/2018, 12:47 - John Begley: So no sci-fi?
22/08/2018, 12:48 - Nathan: Feel free to come and pack
22/08/2018, 12:48 - John Begley: Na.
28/08/2018, 12:16 - Spam: Any form of fi expected this week?
28/08/2018, 12:18 - Nathan: Yeah, fi of the sci kind
28/08/2018, 12:22 - Spam: Wow
28/08/2018, 20:01 - Luke: Yeh, I'm up for sci-fi tomorrow. Also may get to finish early 🤞
29/08/2018, 07:57 - Olly: I'm hoping for a sci fi next week - I've got my first day back at work today and don't think I'll make it to London town...
29/08/2018, 08:30 - John Begley: Dont think I'll make it either
29/08/2018, 08:54 - James A: On holiday this week!
29/08/2018, 13:23 - Luke: Hey, Sam and Nathan, are you still fancying sci-fi tonight?
29/08/2018, 13:24 - Nathan: I'm dead set on it
29/08/2018, 13:29 - Spam: I’m unsure
29/08/2018, 16:08 - Luke: I'm still up for some sci-fi/hang out. What time you going to be in camberwell Nathan?
29/08/2018, 16:09 - Nathan: I'll be back about 5
29/08/2018, 16:09 - Luke: Nice, see you then!
29/08/2018, 16:10 - Nathan: Cool!
29/08/2018, 16:53 - Spam: Sorry I’m goin have to work till about 6 and I need to sort stuff out at home for holiday
04/09/2018, 22:03 - Nathan: No sci-fi tomorrow. Back next week though.
04/09/2018, 23:04 - John Begley: I'm starting to miss really old shit sci-fi. Haven't seen any in ages
05/09/2018, 10:32 - Nathan: I don't think there's any left
06/09/2018, 18:58 - Nathan: <Media omitted>
06/09/2018, 18:59 - John Begley: Hahahahaha
06/09/2018, 19:02 - James A: Amazing
06/09/2018, 19:03 - Olly: Hahaha
06/09/2018, 19:37 - Nathan: From now on, trumpets are banned from sci-fi night.
06/09/2018, 20:08 - James A: Completely unenforceable
06/09/2018, 20:31 - Luke: Amazing. Another rule for the sci-fi night bureaucracy
11/09/2018, 16:37 - Nathan: Sci-fi tomorrow?
11/09/2018, 16:44 - Olly: Yes
11/09/2018, 16:45 - John Begley: I'm in
11/09/2018, 16:47 - Luke: 👍
11/09/2018, 21:38 - James A: Cool

12/09/2018, 19:25 - Nathan: It's worth asking Bright printers in Camberwell. An A1 poster is £20 but there might be good bulk discounts and I can collect very easily.
18/09/2018, 19:23 - Nathan: Sci-fi tomorrow?
18/09/2018, 19:43 - John Begley: Yes

03/10/2018, 13:32 - John Begley: Why has there been no response other than me?
03/10/2018, 13:47 - Olly: Because I've gone temporarily mute today. Can't make it today
03/10/2018, 13:53 - Luke: Uni till december :(
03/10/2018, 16:47 - James A: Hey sorry busy day. Will drop in for a pint, not sure about film
03/10/2018, 17:19 - Spam: Last swim today, then I’ll be back to sci-fi full time, just as it ends
03/10/2018, 19:01 - John Begley: Your missing in depth chat about music documentary night.
03/10/2018, 19:18 - Spam: You’re missing some wearable tech
03/10/2018, 19:18 - Spam: <Media omitted>
04/10/2018, 10:10 - Nathan: The tech looks amazing! How was the swim?
04/10/2018, 10:12 - Nathan: Last night was the last sci-fi for a while. Music film night begins next week! I'm taking suggestions...

04/10/2018, 16:09 - Luke: What is the scope of film music night? Is it just documentaries?
04/10/2018, 16:12 - Nathan: It's broad. Any music related film. No shit musicals though.
09/10/2018, 20:36 - James A: https://www.wired.com/story/irl-glasses-screen-blocking/
09/10/2018, 20:36 - James A: Nice reference to They Live
09/10/2018, 21:01 - Nathan: Brilliant. They should be compulsory at sci-fi night.
09/10/2018, 21:02 - Nathan: Anyone coming to music-related film night tomorrow?
09/10/2018, 21:17 - John Begley: <Media omitted>
09/10/2018, 21:18 - John Begley: Music-related film night is load uninteresting shite
09/10/2018, 21:18 - John Begley: I'll be there though
09/10/2018, 21:19 - Luke: Izzy suggested giving it the catchier name of hi-fi
09/10/2018, 21:19 - Luke: Though whatever we call it, I can't make it
09/10/2018, 21:22 - John Begley: Hahahahah
09/10/2018, 21:22 - John Begley: Hi-fi is good too
09/10/2018, 21:24 - John Begley: Although not fiction. Truth. Mu-tru
09/10/2018, 21:26 - Olly: Mu-tru may be considerably better if we all wear the glasses in James's article!
09/10/2018, 21:28 - Luke: We did allow skifi ... though I accept that our rules arbitrarily change
09/10/2018, 21:29 - Olly: It was ski fi for snowboarders though... Tentative I know
09/10/2018, 21:29 - John Begley: We did all agree on pizza that night whilst it snowed. Classic exemption clause
10/10/2018, 10:27 - Olly: I can't make it to mu-true this time I'm afraid. I will look forward to reluctantly watching music documentaries another time
10/10/2018, 10:57 - Nathan: Trusic night, please

24/10/2018, 15:37 - James A: I’ll be over for about twenty past six. What course are you doing John?
24/10/2018, 15:46 - John Begley: It's a masters in language testing. It's linguistics with a bit of statistics
24/10/2018, 15:46 - John Begley: It's not as interesting as it sounds
24/10/2018, 15:46 - John Begley: And it sounds boring
24/10/2018, 15:59 - James A: I dunno that sounds like it could be pretty interesting. I had a look at doing some
stuff in python and some of the language processing libraries you can get. Didn’t get very far because I’m very lazy.
24/10/2018, 16:00 - John Begley: There might be some language processing stuff later in the course. But not what I'm doing now

06/11/2018, 08:19 - Nathan: I recommend just watching their actual Live Aid '85 performance a few times instead.
06/11/2018, 08:59 - Luke: Fair enough. Have you seen the film and not rated it then? Or is the love performance just that good?
06/11/2018, 15:26 - Nathan: I saw it and thoroughly enjoyed it, but it's awful and the best bit is the recreation of the Live Aid performance.
06/11/2018, 15:36 - Luke: Haha, will check it out.
06/11/2018, 22:33 - Nathan: Hi-fi tomorrow?

17/04/2019, 12:51 - Olly: I'm not joining in, but I feel guilty about it... I think a little civil disobedience is the least that is required if it can possibly help avoid famine and wars in a decade or two. But I think they could try harder, cause a bit more disruption??
17/04/2019, 12:51 - Olly: My views are of course easier for someone that lives outside London though...
17/04/2019, 12:57 - Luke: Waterloo bridge was nicely carless when I cycled over it yesterday so I'm a fan. Few too many hippies in the way but still good

08/05/2019, 09:40 - Nathan: I thought you were dead?
08/05/2019, 09:53 - James A: No just resting
08/05/2019, 11:40 - John Begley: Yes. Forgot the controller. Sorry. I haven't even used it
08/05/2019, 11:41 - John Begley: Though as soon as I take it out of my house, the chance of it being lost forever increases dramatically
08/05/2019, 11:41 - John Begley: Might be best it you collect it
08/05/2019, 15:04 - John Begley: From what time does it start?

15/05/2019, 07:43 - Luke: Yeh I'm up for some hi-fi

08/07/2019, 11:19 - Luke: 😮 what happened to the air lifted guy? Yeh that makes sense, nothing more demoralising than running up hills for 5 hours
08/07/2019, 11:26 - John Begley: I think they fucked their leg
08/07/2019, 11:26 - John Begley: It was ankle breaking territory all the way round

02/10/2019, 14:07 - James A: Can’t make it tonight
02/10/2019, 18:44 - Luke: Hey guys, can you help my housing group with an important tech question 👨‍💻We are nearly a 100% sure that a council is editing a policy of there's in a way which updates pdfs/word docs of the policy on people's personal computers when you open them. This means that there is no way of proving what the policy used to be - unless you have a printed copy. We just want to know whether there is a mechanism which allows a creator of a document to do this? has anyone heard of this being possible? And can you link me to anything that talks about this. This may sound weird, but could be really important in a court case.
02/10/2019, 18:51 - Nathan: <Media omitted>
02/10/2019, 19:07 - John Begley: Well I think Nathan's sorted that one Luke
02/10/2019, 19:08 - Luke: Lol cheers
02/10/2019, 19:08 - John Begley: But also on your pdf thing, i have never heard of that. Unless they are saving it on a cloud as some sort of linked document.
02/10/2019, 19:11 - John Begley: But on their own computer, never heard of that, i feel like if that technology exists you would know that you were giving permission. Standard Adobe reader doesnt even allow editing if you dont have the full version.
02/10/2019, 19:16 - Luke: Yeh completely agree. But we have proof it has happened, as we have copied parts of the old policy into letters and it is different to what is now in the pdfs on our computers (including my work server). So we're kind of going a bit insane as can't understand how it is happening
02/10/2019, 19:40 - John Begley: Mad. Yeah never heard of that. No idea how it could be done, sounds like some mad hacking skillz
02/10/2019, 21:12 - Luke: That's the really annoying thing, it is a council, so it's going to be pretty simple 😓
03/10/2019, 15:14 - Nathan: Anyone interested in Glastonbury tickets for next year?
03/10/2019, 16:57 - Olly: Good question! ...

09/10/2019, 15:42 - Luke: Lol, the main issue is less my sobriety and more that trains out of Peterborough are massively delayed. Currently looks like I'll get to Camberwell for 5.30? So if you're in a pub I'll come join you then 🤷‍♂
09/10/2019, 15:57 - Spam: Haha sounds good

27/11/2019, 15:48 - John Begley: Hope you feel better. Fi.
03/12/2019, 15:27 - Olly: Are you recovered from illfi Nathan? If so I can stay extra-late at mutrue tomorrow, as I'm not going to work the following day. Maybe I'll stay until 9pm! Let's not get too carried away though
03/12/2019, 15:56 - Nathan: Yeah! I think it's on for tomorrow.
03/12/2019, 20:21 - Luke: Yeh, I'm up for it
04/12/2019, 12:45 - John Begley: I'm there
04/12/2019, 17:03 - Luke: I'll be there about 6.30
04/12/2019, 17:06 - Nathan: Cool. See you then.
04/12/2019, 17:06 - John Begley: Half 5
04/12/2019, 17:28 - Olly: 630ish
04/12/2019, 17:29 - Olly: 645ish
04/12/2019, 21:39 - John Begley: Bye
04/12/2019, 22:53 - Luke: Obviously Sam doesn't need this, but for the rest of us this is a 5 minute "how to canvass" video to get us ready for the weekend

06/12/2019, 18:18 - Nathan: https://events.labour.org.uk/event/308380
06/12/2019, 18:19 - Nathan: Gonna go to this and see what happens...
06/12/2019, 18:32 - Luke: <Media omitted>
06/12/2019, 18:42 - Nathan: Are you sure the canvassing is actually gonna be there? But yeah...I don't mind
06/12/2019, 18:48 - Luke: It does say it is campaigning for Neil Coyle, so I think it is in that area. I'll look up other options
06/12/2019, 19:04 - Nathan: https://events.labour.org.uk/event/308145
06/12/2019, 19:04 - Nathan: How about that?
06/12/2019, 19:09 - Luke: Yeh! The 10.30 time?
06/12/2019, 20:49 - Luke: We doing this?! 🌹🌹🌹💪
06/12/2019, 21:17 - Nathan: Hell yeah!
06/12/2019, 22:06 - Luke: 🤟
10/12/2019, 20:58 - Nathan: Hi-fi?
10/12/2019, 21:19 - Olly: I'm planning on enjoying some jetlag tomorrow, so will opt out I'm afraid
10/12/2019, 21:33 - Luke: I'm up for it
11/12/2019, 11:45 - Luke: <Media omitted>
11/12/2019, 11:49 - John Begley: I'm up for either
11/12/2019, 12:28 - Luke: Cool, yeh I'm not at work today so happy to meet up beforehand (whether hifi or pre-corbyn)
11/12/2019, 14:21 - Nathan: I'll be back about 6pm. Let's rally!
11/12/2019, 15:40 - Luke: Amazing! Should we meet there, or go from Camberwell? Hoxton is a 25 min on the orange line from Denmark hill
11/12/2019, 15:42 - John Begley: A lot quicker for me to go straight there
11/12/2019, 15:53 - Luke: Cool, what time do you want to meet there?
11/12/2019, 16:02 - John Begley: I finish at 5ish. Takes me about half hour to get there
11/12/2019, 16:50 - Luke: Nathan, do you want to head up together on the 6.13 train from Denmark hill? Or are you going to go direct (and then I would leave a bit earlier to meet John)
11/12/2019, 16:51 - John Begley: I can also stay at work a bit longer so we arrive at the same time...
11/12/2019, 16:51 - Nathan: I'm just collecting a bike (another snapped frame). Not sure if it's rideable yet. All depends.
11/12/2019, 16:51 - John Begley: I don't want to though
11/12/2019, 16:57 - Luke: Lol (another snapped frame!)

John, do you want to get there about 6. And either me and Iz will get there at 6, or if Nathan's bike works we'll all get there at just after 6.30?
11/12/2019, 17:05 - Nathan: I'm gonna go home first. Will be ready to leave about 1745
11/12/2019, 17:06 - John Begley: I'm leaving now but will wait in a pub if no ones there no problem
11/12/2019, 17:10 - Luke: Great! Nathan do you want to get the train from Denmark hill, there is one at 5.58?
11/12/2019, 17:11 - Nathan: Sure
11/12/2019, 17:11 - Luke: 👍
11/12/2019, 18:17 - John Begley: I'm in the marksman pub. What's your eta and il leave to arrive at the same time
11/12/2019, 18:21 - Luke: We'll come meet you in the pub!
11/12/2019, 18:21 - John Begley: It's a really bad pub
11/12/2019, 18:21 - John Begley: Are there any others that you know?
11/12/2019, 18:22 - Luke: Come meet us at hoxton station?
11/12/2019, 18:22 - John Begley: There isn't any space for people not eating
11/12/2019, 18:22 - John Begley: It's weird
11/12/2019, 18:22 - Luke: Nathan says there are pubs at hoxton station
11/12/2019, 18:23 - John Begley: Cool 10 mins?
11/12/2019, 18:33 - Nathan: We came to your pub. You are not here.
11/12/2019, 18:34 - John Begley: I'm walking bak
11/12/2019, 23:58 - Luke: <Media omitted>
12/12/2019, 07:50 - Olly: 7.29am
12/12/2019, 08:57 - Nathan: When it stops raining
12/12/2019, 08:58 - Luke: Lol
12/12/2019, 09:22 - James A: Two days ago
12/12/2019, 09:39 - Luke: O also, you're all welcome round mine tonight to watch the election results if you fancy it? Prob from 8pm onwards, then see what the exit poll says and go from there.
12/12/2019, 09:52 - Olly: Thanks Luke! But I'm not up for watching a slow crushing tory-triumph depressathon tonight. A short sharp painful shock tomorrow is my choice. And if the Tories don't win, I promise to join in any victory parties that might occur on Sat evening
12/12/2019, 10:12 - Luke: Probably a good shout!
12/12/2019, 10:23 - John Begley: Hahahahaha
12/12/2019, 22:01 - John Begley: That's a shame
12/12/2019, 22:02 - Spam: Very depressing
12/12/2019, 22:03 - John Begley: What a cunt
12/12/2019, 22:33 - Luke: So fucked
12/12/2019, 22:41 - John Begley: Why do they keep banging on about the first December election in the UK since 1923?
12/12/2019, 22:41 - John Begley: <Media omitted>
12/12/2019, 22:46 - John Begley: And who gives a shit about the blyth Valley counting record?
12/12/2019, 23:37 - Luke: Fucking Blythe valley
17/12/2019, 19:38 - Nathan: Hi-fi?
17/12/2019, 19:43 - Olly: Yes sir
17/12/2019, 19:43 - Luke: 👍
18/12/2019, 17:08 - Luke: Hey Nathan, when you getting back? I'll be in Camberwell about 5.45
18/12/2019, 17:15 - Olly: Just found out all trains cancelled, sorry can't make it
18/12/2019, 17:29 - Nathan: I'm back
18/12/2019, 17:29 - Nathan: Sorry Olly!
18/12/2019, 17:51 - Olly: It wasn't all your fault
18/12/2019, 17:52 - Olly: :-)
18/12/2019, 17:54 - John Begley: Hey. I'm going home. Im coughing every 10 seconds and just want to be in bed...
18/12/2019, 18:19 - John Begley: This message was deleted
18/12/2019, 18:19 - John Begley: This message was deleted
03/01/2020, 13:59 - Nathan: Happy New Year!
03/01/2020, 13:59 - Nathan: Anyone doing anything this evening/weekend?
03/01/2020, 14:03 - Spam: Sat?
03/01/2020, 14:04 - Nathan: Yeah?
06/01/2020, 20:26 - Spam: How do people feel about turning next hi-fi night into a lesson on a conplicated german card game
06/01/2020, 20:27 - Spam: *complicated
06/01/2020, 20:28 - John Begley: I'm in. Hi-fi was ever my thing.
06/01/2020, 20:39 - Nathan: I'm in. 15th?
06/01/2020, 20:39 - Spam: 8th?
06/01/2020, 20:39 - John Begley: Can't do 8 th
06/01/2020, 20:40 - Spam: I can do 15th
06/01/2020, 20:40 - Spam: We need one more taker
06/01/2020, 20:40 - Spam: Or two is also fine
06/01/2020, 20:41 - John Begley: The game sounds very Oli
06/01/2020, 20:56 - Luke: I'm in!
06/01/2020, 22:08 - Spam: Nice
06/01/2020, 22:59 - Olly: Im in for 15th, if there is space
07/01/2020, 08:57 - Spam: Definitely
07/01/2020, 08:57 - Spam: I can’t really believe the enthusiasm for something I’ve just sold as complicated and German
07/01/2020, 09:22 - Olly: There are only a handful of things in life that I like better than a complicated German game!
07/01/2020, 09:41 - John Begley: Have you forgotten how we select films?
12/01/2020, 19:40 - Olly: Doplekopf is a 4 player game.
12/01/2020, 19:41 - Olly: Do we have 4 people?
12/01/2020, 19:43 - Olly: Other than that, from looking at the rules, all I gleaned was that it is a very complex game, with more special cards to remember than there are normal cards...
12/01/2020, 22:38 - Spam: We have 5 people
12/01/2020, 22:38 - Spam: Which is ideal
12/01/2020, 22:38 - Spam: Your assessment of the complexity is spot on
12/01/2020, 22:46 - Olly: Can I be the 5th person (the one that doesn't play)?
12/01/2020, 22:46 - Olly: 🙂
13/01/2020, 07:48 - Spam: Haha that rotates
15/01/2020, 07:34 - Spam: I’m goin drip feed you rules throughout the day
15/01/2020, 07:42 - Spam: The first is simple, the overall aim of the game is to win tricks, the cards have different value. The team with the most value at end gets a point.
15/01/2020, 08:34 - Olly: Great
15/01/2020, 09:22 - You added Dodo
15/01/2020, 09:28 - Nathan: Could you repeat that for Fumi, please?
15/01/2020, 09:28 - Spam: I’m goin drip feed you rules throughout the day
15/01/2020, 09:28 - Spam: The first is simple, the overall aim of the game is to win tricks, the cards have different value. The team with the most value at end gets a point.
15/01/2020, 09:28 - Spam: I feel like you could have done that :)?
15/01/2020, 09:29 - Nathan: It's better coming from you
15/01/2020, 09:29 - Spam: Haha
15/01/2020, 09:30 - Spam: Next fact, we play with no packs of cards merged, but with everything below 9 removed (ace is high)
15/01/2020, 09:30 - Spam: *two packs
15/01/2020, 10:28 - Spam: This is a crucial rule: the partners are determined each round by the players the hold the queen of clubs (re) and those that don’t (contra)
15/01/2020, 10:40 - Spam: So in terms of card ranking, I’ll admit it is confusing, but once you’ve learnt it makes sense. 

You have to follow suit, and the highest card of that suit wins unless it is trumped.

Non trumps in order - aces, 10s, kings, nines

trumps in order - 10s 💓, all queens, all jacks, all diamonds (in usual order)

The suit ranking where necessary is clubs, spades, hearts, diamonds
15/01/2020, 10:49 - John Begley: How do we ensure that one player doesn't have both queen of clubs?
15/01/2020, 11:05 - Spam: Excellent question, if a player has both then they have a wedding. Before the games start they have a choice of keeping silent and playing alone against the rest as the team, or declaring they have a wedding, then the first person to win a non trump hand plays with them.
15/01/2020, 11:34 - Nathan: Civil partnership?
15/01/2020, 12:01 - Spam: Next rule, the foxes. These are the ace of diamonds. You have to try and bring them home. If your opponents win a trick with your fox you lose a point at end (equivalent to the point for winning the most tricks)
15/01/2020, 12:01 - Spam: If you have both foxes in your hand, then they are pigs, and become the highest card in the game.
15/01/2020, 12:43 - Spam: I imagine you guys are eating lunch now, frustrated I haven’t sent more rules for you to learn. So card values:

Aces = 11
Tens = 10
Kings, queens, jacks = 4,3,2
Nine = 0
15/01/2020, 12:45 - Spam: As I’m sure you’ve already worked out that means you need to reach 121 to win
15/01/2020, 13:24 - Luke: Confused on the points. How does this, and the need to reach 121 interact?
15/01/2020, 13:26 - Spam: I struggled to find right words, there are micro points to determine who wins each game (by getting 121). And macro points, ie you would get one macro point for winning the game by 121 or by catching a fox
15/01/2020, 13:27 - Spam: Macro points are what you keep a running total through the evening and determines overall winner
15/01/2020, 13:28 - Luke: Cheers, though I was confused because you said highest card value gets the macro point, but then that we have to get 121 (not highest points) to get the macro point
15/01/2020, 13:30 - Spam: If the losing team doesn’t get 120 (always the case) you get one macro point, if they don’t get 90 you get two macro points, no 60 three points etc
15/01/2020, 13:31 - Spam: I may not have answered your question but instead just given you more confusing info
15/01/2020, 13:31 - Spam: I hope it answers it though
15/01/2020, 13:32 - Luke: Lol, yeh the scoring system keeps changing with each messagr, I like it
15/01/2020, 13:59 - Spam: Let me add yet more to the score system then, in first 6 cards dealt you have opportunity to call that you will win the game. This does a few things, doubles your points if do win, let’s everyone know if you have queen of clubs - you say re if you have it, contra if you don’t, but if you lose it also doubles points for opponent.
15/01/2020, 14:41 - Spam: I think I’ve covered the basics
15/01/2020, 14:42 - Spam: Couple of other ways to win macro points
15/01/2020, 14:42 - Spam: 1) win the last hand with a jack of clubs
15/01/2020, 14:42 - Spam: 2) win a hand of exclusively 10s and aces
15/01/2020, 15:10 - Spam: So Sam, there are two packs of cards, so identical cards, so who wins if two people play the same card?
15/01/2020, 15:12 - Spam: Great question Sam. So the first card played wins, except for 10♥ where second one wins unless it is on last hand where first 10♥ wins
15/01/2020, 16:35 - Spam: Another way to win macro point
15/01/2020, 16:36 - Spam: 3) against the olds, team without queens wins
15/01/2020, 17:28 - Spam: So everyone understands the about 70% of the rules now
15/01/2020, 17:29 - Spam: I will text out a quiz on my bus journey
15/01/2020, 17:29 - Spam: Im sure I will get lots of replies
15/01/2020, 17:36 - Spam: Hand 1 in order played:
Luke - ace clubs
Sam - nine clubs
Nathan - 10 clubs
Ollie - nine diamonds

Who wins?
15/01/2020, 17:37 - Dodo: Olly
15/01/2020, 17:39 - Spam: Nice, correct Ollie wins with trumps. Also, we know Ollie has no clubs (or doesn’t understand the rules)
15/01/2020, 17:41 - Olly: Ollie is the least likely to win, as he hasn't read any of this (apologies)
15/01/2020, 17:43 - Spam: Hand 2 in order played:
Ollie - jack diamonds 
Luke - queen clubs
Sam - nine diamonds
Nathan - ace of diamonds

Who wins? What else have we learnt?
15/01/2020, 18:03 - Spam: Pub or flat?

15/01/2020, 18:31 - Olly: I've read the rules now. They are very silly.
15/01/2020, 21:35 - Nathan: <Media omitted>
15/01/2020, 21:40 - Olly: I think everyone can agree that I was pretty good at that game. Bringing home the pigs almost every turn...
16/01/2020, 07:56 - Spam: Home time for the black fox
16/01/2020, 08:14 - Luke: Lol. I'm shocked to find that black foxes are actually a thing (outside of doppelkopf) https://www.blackfoxes.co.uk/
23/01/2020, 07:16 - Olly: Carrie and I are going to hemel Hempstead snow dome (or what ever it's called) 7ish tonight for a ski. £35pp inc hire. Join and have a ski fi!
23/01/2020, 14:46 - Nathan: Sorry Olly (and Carrie), I'm in the grip of a John-like deadline paralysis.
23/01/2020, 14:48 - John Begley: Staring into the middle distance and doing no work at all?
23/01/2020, 14:48 - John Begley: I'm up for this. But not this evening. Next time you go though let me know
23/01/2020, 15:21 - Olly: Good luck Nathan! Carpentry could help?
11/02/2020, 20:42 - Nathan: Hi-fi?

11/03/2020, 07:06 - John Begley: Hi fi?
11/03/2020, 07:22 - Olly: Unfortunately not for me
11/03/2020, 07:48 - Nathan: Nor me. Watching football with Steven Hardwick in a local sports bar in case anyone else fancies it? Winner plays on will feature The Black Death vs F91 Dudelange.
17/03/2020, 16:35 - Nathan: Hi-fi?
17/03/2020, 16:39 - Spam: Virtual or real?

17/03/2020, 16:43 - Spam: I was meant to meet nico, but I doubt he’ll be coming to London now
17/03/2020, 16:47 - Olly: I need to try to delay being infected until march 29th, so minimal mass transit for me I'm afraid
17/03/2020, 16:59 - John Begley: I'll probably come
17/03/2020, 17:15 - Spam: I’ll definitely come

27/03/2020, 10:36 - Olly: Good tip John. So many complications and issues this month, but we will be moved!
08/04/2020, 15:58 - Nathan: Anyone fancy a v pint tonight?
08/04/2020, 17:24 - Dodo: Vey pint

08/04/2020, 17:26 - Olly: I can join for one
08/04/2020, 17:26 - John Begley: But where?
08/04/2020, 17:30 - Nathan: What's your favourite? Skype and zoom have both been good to me.
08/04/2020, 17:33 - Luke: Would be up for it. I am a big fan of virtual alcohol. But on another group call right now
08/04/2020, 17:33 - Spam: Maybe let me know when

14/04/2020, 15:13 - Nathan: Hi-fi tomorrow?
14/04/2020, 18:32 - Luke: Virtual or illegal?
14/04/2020, 18:55 - Nathan: Good question. I'm up for either.
14/04/2020, 19:29 - Luke: Lol. I'm up for virtual. Still 100% into this lockdown ✊
14/04/2020, 19:32 - John Begley: I'm in. How we doing this?
14/04/2020, 19:32 - John Begley: Are we voting tonight?
14/04/2020, 21:03 - Luke: We still voting?! What for?
14/04/2020, 21:05 - Luke: Wait, are we actually going to watch a film?
14/04/2020, 22:51 - Nathan: I hadn't really considered that as an option. Let's discuss it tomorrow.
14/04/2020, 22:52 - John Begley: Do I have to get takeaway too?
14/04/2020, 22:53 - Nathan: Yes. I vote Morley's.
14/04/2020, 22:53 - John Begley: Do we all have to get the same takeaway?
14/04/2020, 22:54 - Nathan: You know the rules
14/04/2020, 22:55 - John Begley: Not sure morleys deliver
14/04/2020, 22:59 - Nathan: There's a Morley's 3 minutes ride from you're house
15/04/2020, 06:42 - John Begley: Uber eats?
15/04/2020, 10:07 - Luke: I have so much food in. I vote Morley's because it is closest to what I'll be eating anyway
15/04/2020, 14:51 - Olly: Sorry can't make it tonight. Plus there is no morleys in st albans
15/04/2020, 16:19 - Luke: What time?
15/04/2020, 16:20 - Nathan: I'm at Longdan, should be back in twenty...
15/04/2020, 16:29 - Luke: I technically don't finish until 5.30 but free from then
15/04/2020, 17:43 - Nathan: Ready when you are
15/04/2020, 17:43 - John Begley: What's the platform?
15/04/2020, 17:43 - Nathan: Let's start on Skype
15/04/2020, 17:50 - John Begley: I have sent a contact request

15/04/2020, 17:51 - Nathan: You sent an email?
15/04/2020, 17:52 - John Begley: I sent a request and got a message box which told me that once you had done something like accept my request, we could talk
15/04/2020, 17:52 - John Begley: On skype
15/04/2020, 17:53 - Luke: I will be on skype in 5 mins. My email is lukesheldon89@gmail.com

29/04/2020, 16:47 - Nathan: Hifi?
29/04/2020, 17:59 - Olly: I can get there, briefly, for 621
29/04/2020, 17:59 - Olly: pm
29/04/2020, 18:20 - Nathan: Perfect
29/04/2020, 18:21 - Olly: ?
29/04/2020, 18:22 - Olly: Which program
29/04/2020, 18:22 - Olly: ?
29/04/2020, 18:22 - Nathan: Skype
29/04/2020, 18:23 - Olly: What's your handle?

01/07/2020, 09:33 - John Begley: Ok
01/07/2020, 09:33 - John Begley: Where?
01/07/2020, 10:21 - Nathan: My house?
01/07/2020, 10:27 - John Begley: Ok
01/07/2020, 11:06 - Olly: I have immediately pending redundancy-meeting-recovery scheduled for tonight I'm afraid 😬
01/07/2020, 13:25 - Luke: Fuck! Sorry to hear Oli. Good luck!
01/07/2020, 13:27 - Luke: If you're in the green at any point let me know and I'll pop by. Have to be careful about following the rules due to work, and also want to avoid indoor interactions as going to stay with my mom in a week
01/07/2020, 14:39 - Nathan: Yeah, Olly, that's a shit. Hope it goes as well possible.
01/07/2020, 14:40 - Nathan: I'm up for a bit of table tennis for starters. When do you finish?
01/07/2020, 15:13 - Luke: Izzy just said it is raining all day. But I will be coming through Camberwell after a run at about 6.15, and if not raining we could give it a go?
01/07/2020, 16:24 - Olly: Cheers guys. Well the meeting was much more positive than I feared: 25-30% of people are being laid off, but amazingly they managed to get that number in voluntary redundancies/early retirements. So they say that shortly I shouldn't be at risk anymore. I'm going to have a 🍺🥃🍹 tonight! (but at home I think as the process has exhausted me!)
01/07/2020, 16:34 - Spam: Great news :)
01/07/2020, 16:35 - John Begley: Wehey!
01/07/2020, 16:35 - John Begley: Great news oli!
01/07/2020, 16:41 - James A: That’s good news Olly, glad to hear it!
01/07/2020, 16:42 - Luke: Amazing! 🎉🎉🎉wow, kind of surprised so many are taking voluntary right now.
01/07/2020, 16:47 - Nathan: Can't believe you didn't take early retirement.
01/07/2020, 17:16 - Olly: Yep Luke I thought there was no way that'd happen either! But I guess that babyboom generation are just swimming in cash, and so can happily retire early!
01/07/2020, 17:21 - Olly: A missed opportunity indeed Nathan. That reminds me - My last pension statement said if I keep paying in for another 30 years I could get maybe a few thousand pounds a year pension if I retire in 30 years time! Imagine the lavishness!
01/07/2020, 17:34 - Nathan: Keep working hard and your dreams will come true
01/07/2020, 17:55 - Luke: Lol! Yeh makes loads of sense when you think about. Weird they kept working so long
01/07/2020, 18:03 - Olly: Ha ha!
01/07/2020, 18:10 - Luke: Sorry, I have massively overran with work, and not going to make it tonight even for some cold table tennis. But Nathan let me know if you fancy a game in next few days, as have afternoons off
01/07/2020, 22:38 - John Begley: What time did we leave same?
01/07/2020, 22:39 - Spam: ?
01/07/2020, 22:43 - John Begley: Also Victoria laughed at the Mackeral buying in eel-ing

28/07/2020, 10:11 - Nathan: Sci-fi tomorrow?
28/07/2020, 10:11 - John Begley: Yep
28/07/2020, 14:01 - Luke: Up for some table tennis/green before the definitely going to happen film
28/07/2020, 14:01 - John Begley: 😂 😂 😂
28/07/2020, 18:05 - Luke: Literally just realised we have now reverted to sci-fi 🙏

29/07/2020, 17:01 - Nathan: Are you here?
29/07/2020, 17:24 - John Begley: I'm in the park
29/07/2020, 17:25 - Nathan: I'm at home. I'll come out
29/07/2020, 17:30 - Luke: I currently have a work emergency. I'll be over soon!
29/07/2020, 18:19 - Luke: That took forever, on my way

05/08/2020, 07:11 - Olly: Not this week I'm afraid 😔
05/08/2020, 07:40 - Luke: I'm up for it
05/08/2020, 08:22 - John Begley: https://youtu.be/zaaTZkqsaxY
05/08/2020, 09:29 - Olly: Do I have to watch him for over 30mins?
05/08/2020, 09:33 - John Begley: It's quite tiring, but funny also
05/08/2020, 09:33 - John Begley: He claims you can do too much testing for corona virus
05/08/2020, 09:34 - John Begley: And when the interview asks who has said that...
05/08/2020, 09:34 - John Begley: DT:‘Read the manuals, read the books.‘
JS:‘What manuals?? What books???‘ hahaha
05/08/2020, 09:39 - Nathan: Can we keep the chat on-topic please.
05/08/2020, 10:20 - Olly: Haha

China making sci-fi night part of the curriculum

"Elementary and middle school students should be made to watch “excellent sci-fi movies,”"
20/08/2020, 07:30 - Nathan: Should I send the list over to Xi? John: They might interested in the poster series too. Could be a good opportunity.
20/08/2020, 07:32 - Olly: Do you think he might get bored and play table tennis whilst the film's play?
20/08/2020, 07:33 - Nathan: That's racial stereotyping and you should be ashamed.
20/08/2020, 07:47 - Luke: John may have to not so subtlety place Xi's face in a few good places. But worth the extra exposure I say
20/08/2020, 07:47 - Olly: Sci-fi-stereotyping more like. That was the last sci fi I attended
20/08/2020, 08:13 - John Begley: Hahahahahahaha
20/08/2020, 08:14 - John Begley: Amazing!
20/08/2020, 08:15 - John Begley: "... made to watch excellent movies". I guess they won't need a Slurry Sunday
20/08/2020, 10:19 - Luke: Haha, they will get to slurry Sunday at one point, it is inevitable. Well up for watching The Wandering Earth at sci-fi though.
20/08/2020, 10:27 - John Begley: Yes please
24/08/2020, 14:14 - Nathan: Let's do it. Wednesday?
24/08/2020, 20:42 - Luke: You still got the scafe?
24/08/2020, 20:44 - Nathan: Yep.
25/08/2020, 11:08 - Olly: I'm game for Wednesday. Not a slurry day, but a normal evening session I assume? Looking forward to seeing at least 10% of a sci-fi
25/08/2020, 11:12 - Nathan: Great. Planning to watch The Wandering Earth (125 mins). Could even schedule a start time?
25/08/2020, 20:43 - Luke: So turns out that Izzy is just as worried about me sitting out on the scaf as being indoors, so can't come. Enjoy though!
26/08/2020, 18:16 - Nathan: <Media omitted>
26/08/2020, 18:16 - Olly: <Media omitted>
26/08/2020, 18:21 - John Begley: Awesome. What film are you playing in the background?
26/08/2020, 19:17 - Luke: Amazing 👌
28/08/2020, 22:31 - Olly: "Make America great again again". Absolutely incredible slogan LMAO
28/08/2020, 23:01 - Luke: Omg that's amazing 😂
02/09/2020, 08:55 - Nathan: Sci-fi?
03/09/2020, 09:49 - Olly: Sorry can't, unless we find a way to go back in time to yesterday
03/09/2020, 09:49 - Nathan: But if we do, you can?
03/09/2020, 09:59 - Olly: Yes, with some caveats.
03/09/2020, 10:00 - Olly: However, uncaveated, if we can find a way to go forward in time to next week then I should be able to go to sci fi. And I know one ground breaking method to go forward in time
03/09/2020, 10:05 - Nathan: Near light-speed travel to Alpha Centauri and back?
03/09/2020, 10:05 - Luke: Just upping the speed to 1.3?
03/09/2020, 10:06 - John Begley: Hahahaha
03/09/2020, 10:27 - James A: 😂It’s a well tested method
03/09/2020, 10:55 - Olly: Haha ha! That's a better method than my idea of sitting in a sealed box for a week and jabbering unintelligibly about palladium etc
09/09/2020, 08:31 - Nathan: Sci-fi?
09/09/2020, 08:31 - John Begley: Next week I will be for sure.
09/09/2020, 09:12 - Olly: As promised I have successfully travelled forwards in time from last week. So yes I can (though can't be a late one for me tonight I'm afraid)
09/09/2020, 13:48 - Luke: If sci-fi is outside at any point, let me know and I'll drop by
09/09/2020, 14:08 - Nathan: Blackfriars pub
09/09/2020, 14:09 - Nathan: I'm guessing 6ish. Olly?
09/09/2020, 14:13 - Spam: Is that a pub in Blackfriars?
09/09/2020, 14:13 - Olly: Sounds good to me. They have outdoor seating Luke

09/09/2020, 14:15 - Spam: Also nearby
09/09/2020, 14:16 - Olly: (The same person says the Blackfriars is also the pub closest to the thameslink route to st albans)
09/09/2020, 14:17 - Olly: But I've noticed that it might be a draw in terms of distance at least
09/09/2020, 14:17 - Olly: (To the dogett)

09/09/2020, 14:51 - John Begley: Someone needs to move to Croydon to complete it
09/09/2020, 15:00 - Olly: I hear Nathans planning on moving to chelford to complete the circle.

09/09/2020, 17:27 - Olly: Be there at 17:58+5.00
09/09/2020, 17:36 - Luke: If there's outside seating I'll pop down for a bit
09/09/2020, 18:07 - Olly: Luke, we have an outdoor bench
16/09/2020, 08:02 - Nathan: Sci-fi?
16/09/2020, 08:28 - John Begley: Yes
16/09/2020, 09:09 - Luke: Yeh! I'll come along at the start if your outdoors?
16/09/2020, 09:19 - Olly: Yes!
16/09/2020, 09:20 - Olly: It's a coolbox thesis special, right?
16/09/2020, 09:35 - John Begley: Hahaha
16/09/2020, 09:35 - John Begley: The coolbox is finished
16/09/2020, 12:58 - Olly: 🤯🥳🤯🥳
16/09/2020, 12:59 - Olly: Congratulations are in order for surviving it!
16/09/2020, 12:59 - John Begley: 😂 Cheers
16/09/2020, 12:59 - John Begley: Very happy. I will never write an essay again
16/09/2020, 13:12 - Luke: Amazing!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
16/09/2020, 13:12 - John Begley: Thanks!
16/09/2020, 13:13 - Dodo: Congrats John💮
16/09/2020, 13:14 - James A: Is this your Masters done John? Well done!
16/09/2020, 13:16 - John Begley: <Media omitted>
16/09/2020, 13:16 - John Begley: Yup, thanks!
16/09/2020, 14:20 - Luke: Are people alright starting outside for a bit, maybe the green? Also what time? I'm off work, so whenevers good for me
16/09/2020, 14:20 - John Begley: Yep. Probably about half 5 though
16/09/2020, 14:24 - Luke: 👍
16/09/2020, 16:52 - John Begley: I am no longer coming. My bike has a puncture and I don't have a spare inner tube
16/09/2020, 16:54 - John Begley: Though everyone is welcome at mine and I have an outdoor but shelter table tennis table
16/09/2020, 16:54 - John Begley: And a TV that is slightly larger than Nathan's. Less films though
16/09/2020, 16:57 - Olly: Bus?
16/09/2020, 16:57 - Olly: Bus no good?
16/09/2020, 16:57 - Olly: I can go to yours
16/09/2020, 16:57 - John Begley: It's two buses. And they often are full up these days and they just don't stop
16/09/2020, 16:58 - Olly: Understood. I'm soon going to catch train, so need to know plan
16/09/2020, 16:59 - John Begley: Nathan is the leader
16/09/2020, 16:59 - Olly: But I want to see Begley!
16/09/2020, 17:00 - Olly: Begley or bust?
16/09/2020, 17:01 - John Begley: Everyone welcome here. Nathan?
16/09/2020, 17:03 - Olly: I just missed the train to your house. I'm going home
16/09/2020, 17:05 - Nathan: Me and Luke are on the Green
16/09/2020, 17:07 - Nathan: Can come to yours, John
16/09/2020, 17:07 - Nathan: Olly, what happened?
16/09/2020, 17:08 - John Begley: He missed the train
16/09/2020, 17:08 - John Begley: All welcome
16/09/2020, 17:08 - Olly: Yep I missed the train by one min. Would have to wait for 30 mins for next one
16/09/2020, 17:09 - Nathan: Shit
16/09/2020, 17:10 - Nathan: You want a puncture repair kit John?
16/09/2020, 17:11 - Olly: Maze hill is less frequent, got unlucky. I've already started back home, there is no going back
16/09/2020, 17:12 - John Begley: If you can teleport it
16/09/2020, 17:14 - Luke: Were leaving now!
16/09/2020, 17:15 - John Begley: Cool
16/09/2020, 17:20 - John Begley: Tell me when you are here
16/09/2020, 17:24 - John Begley: Table tennis
16/09/2020, 17:24 - John Begley: ?
16/09/2020, 17:46 - Nathan: Here!
17/09/2020, 13:00 - John Begley: https://youtu.be/SvelUGKffjk
18/09/2020, 18:05 - Olly: I was randomly chosen by nhs/imperial to do a self-administer covid antibody test. Anyone want to see a bloodied test kit? (I was going to just post it 'cause I thought it was cool, but then realised someone might faint at sight of blood)
18/09/2020, 18:06 - Nathan: Hmmm...I might be interested
18/09/2020, 18:24 - Luke: I'm up for it
18/09/2020, 18:24 - John Begley: Yes please. I would like to see the blood
18/09/2020, 18:25 - Olly: Here's the blood:
18/09/2020, 18:25 - Olly: <Media omitted>
18/09/2020, 18:25 - Olly: No antibodies
18/09/2020, 18:25 - Olly: But very inaccurate blood insertion
18/09/2020, 18:26 - John Begley: So do you have to report the result to the government?
18/09/2020, 18:26 - Luke: Do they do a non-self administer test to check this one worked?
18/09/2020, 18:26 - Olly: I had to also fill in a very long questionnaire
18/09/2020, 18:26 - Nathan: Cool, so the whole test is done at home? No lab required?
18/09/2020, 18:27 - Olly: Result in 10 minutes, but less than 15 minutes, as they say
18/09/2020, 18:28 - Olly: They said they might follow up again in the future, but it's all done for now
18/09/2020, 18:28 - John Begley: A shame you haven't had it. We're you disappointed?
18/09/2020, 18:29 - John Begley: I would be
18/09/2020, 18:29 - Olly: And I've trusted imperial college with 20 years of my medical records. I didn't really like that bit so much
18/09/2020, 18:30 - Olly: I was definitely disappointed. For one thing I kind of assumed that I've already had it, no I have to be careful again
18/09/2020, 18:30 - Olly: *so not no
18/09/2020, 18:31 - Luke: To be fair, you may have had it, but now lost the antibodies
18/09/2020, 18:55 - Olly: Good point. Rubbish antibodies
22/09/2020, 21:24 - Nathan: Sci-fi tomorrow?
23/09/2020, 07:10 - Olly: Was planning to, but Carrie just got her visa through, might be celebrating instead
23/09/2020, 07:29 - James A: Congratulations! That’s great news!
23/09/2020, 08:12 - Luke: 🥳🥳🥳
23/09/2020, 09:00 - Olly: Cheers guys!
23/09/2020, 09:01 - John Begley: Yes! Send my congrats to Carrie.
23/09/2020, 09:01 - John Begley: Probably yes for scifi too
23/09/2020, 09:02 - Luke: So I changed phones last night so never got the message about scifi tonight, but assume from others that it is happening. Definitely up for popping down if your outside for any of it
23/09/2020, 12:52 - Nathan: Congrats! Are we all invited?
23/09/2020, 12:53 - Nathan: The forecast for this evening is not very outdoors friendly.
23/09/2020, 13:06 - Luke: <Media omitted>
29/09/2020, 17:43 - Nathan: Sci-fi tomorrow? Last one for a few weeks.
29/09/2020, 20:23 - Olly: Damn, I was hoping for the inverse
29/09/2020, 22:26 - John Begley: Probably, depending on work
29/09/2020, 22:31 - John Begley: Actually I am coming. It seems like it might be our last legal scifi for a will if there are further covid restrictions
30/09/2020, 07:34 - Luke: I've got uni on Wednesday for the next 3 months 😞 hopefully scifi will be legal again by then 🤞
29/10/2020, 18:33 - Luke: <Media omitted>
29/10/2020, 18:33 - Luke: <Media omitted>
29/10/2020, 18:51 - John Begley: Shit burger?
29/10/2020, 19:05 - Luke: Haha, I suppose it's going to have to be
02/11/2020, 12:48 - Olly: This classifies as sci fi:
02/11/2020, 12:48 - Olly: <Media omitted>
02/11/2020, 12:48 - Olly: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-54718671
02/11/2020, 19:48 - Nathan: Thanks for sharing with me. You're a good person.
30/11/2020, 21:17 - John Begley: Virtual sci fi night at some point?
30/11/2020, 21:25 - Olly: Agreed
30/11/2020, 21:45 - Nathan: This Wednesday?
30/11/2020, 22:33 - John Begley: I'll be in
30/11/2020, 22:33 - Luke: Well up for this. But have lectures on Wednesdays 😞
30/11/2020, 22:34 - John Begley: I will also be in... Any other night
30/11/2020, 22:35 - Luke: Lol
30/11/2020, 22:35 - John Begley: Thursday?
30/11/2020, 22:37 - Luke: Good for me 👌
30/11/2020, 22:39 - Olly: Doh I'm climbing on Thursday
30/11/2020, 22:41 - John Begley: Does someone else want to nominally say the name of a day?
30/11/2020, 22:42 - Luke: 😂
01/12/2020, 03:16 - Nathan: Tuesday?
01/12/2020, 07:20 - Olly: Don't think I can do tonight either sorry I was assuming Wed when I agreed to it! But no worries I'll join next week
01/12/2020, 07:27 - Nathan: I thought none of you were allowed out, what's going on?
01/12/2020, 07:31 - Olly: Gyms and climbing open Wed/Thurs!
02/12/2020, 10:54 - John Begley: Victoria has parents evening tonight and so it is a perfect opportunity for me to dominate the living room with a simultaneous sci-fi/zoom call experience. If we did it, how old it work?
02/12/2020, 10:54 - John Begley: How would* it work?
02/12/2020, 12:18 - Nathan: I guess we'd simultaneously watch a sci-fi while zoom calling. Could we knock together a shortlist of sci-fis available on netflix/prime for a traditional elimination vote via screen share? The food vote is more tricky. Maybe we could just vote for or against eating to simplify things. I'm free from half five.
02/12/2020, 12:21 - John Begley: Agreed. Regarding the food vote, we could each present a list of ingredients we all have avaliable. The ingredients that we all have in common are the only things you are allowed to use to create a meal.
02/12/2020, 13:36 - Olly: Bombay bad boy pot noodles Ann's pumpkin pie
02/12/2020, 13:36 - Olly: *and not anns
02/12/2020, 13:37 - Olly: Is it tonight? Can make 6.15
02/12/2020, 13:43 - John Begley: I'm assuming you can stay for half and hour and then shoot off when the film starts?
02/12/2020, 13:50 - Nathan: Perfect, I have last night's clam juice and and a rotten banana
02/12/2020, 13:51 - John Begley: I have none of those things
02/12/2020, 13:53 - Dodo: we've also got quince jam, sardines and capers
02/12/2020, 13:54 - John Begley: <Media omitted>
02/12/2020, 13:54 - John Begley: ... We could have a dinner here
02/12/2020, 13:54 - John Begley: Oli?
02/12/2020, 13:55 - Dodo: cat/dog biscuits?
02/12/2020, 14:11 - John Begley: Yes!!!!
02/12/2020, 14:54 - Olly: No sardines. Only dog biscuits
02/12/2020, 14:57 - John Begley: Well let's scrap that idea then. I'm not eating cat food.
02/12/2020, 16:54 - Luke: Have you guys adopted a sicilian cat/dog??!
02/12/2020, 17:24 - Nathan: Maybe...
02/12/2020, 17:26 - James A: Can’t do this evening, but maybe a future one if not on a Wednesday. Have a good one!
02/12/2020, 17:39 - Luke: Lol. Photos? Or you just keeping the mystery going?
02/12/2020, 17:53 - Nathan: Nah, just too off-topic
02/12/2020, 18:06 - Luke: Pets are not off topic from scifi. Are we forgetting a boy and his dog
02/12/2020, 18:07 - Nathan: But it was a post-apocalyptic dog
02/12/2020, 18:19 - Olly: How do I join
02/12/2020, 18:19 - Olly: ?
02/12/2020, 18:21 - Nathan: I'm just about to eat. 30 mins?
02/12/2020, 18:21 - Olly: Ok
02/12/2020, 18:54 - Nathan: https://us04web.zoom.us/j/4239535685?pwd=Zml4WUxzNFB2NkRRYkxjd3d2QzN6UT09
02/12/2020, 18:58 - Olly: Meeting id?
02/12/2020, 18:58 - Olly: Because that website is too long for me
02/12/2020, 18:58 - Nathan: Yes
02/12/2020, 19:41 - Olly: The meeting ended
02/12/2020, 19:41 - Olly: Excellent way to end a meeting though
02/12/2020, 19:41 - John Begley: Hahahaha
02/12/2020, 19:41 - Nathan: Just rejoin. If you want to
02/12/2020, 19:41 - Olly: No trail off
02/12/2020, 19:41 - Nathan: Okay
02/12/2020, 19:42 - Olly: Ok
08/12/2020, 18:05 - Luke: Hi everyone, sorry for the non-scifi spam. The housing group I'm part of are doing an email campaign about the treatment of overcrowded families by Southwark council (it's really really bad). You can easily send an automated email with the link below. If your able to send an email that would be great, and if you can send it to others who would be interested that would also be great! They are trying to get to 500 emails
 https://t.co/XAyH0noSVi?amp=1
09/12/2020, 11:13 - Nathan: Done, and good luck!
09/12/2020, 13:09 - Luke: Cheers!
09/12/2020, 13:09 - John Begley: Same
09/12/2020, 13:59 - Luke: 🥳👍
09/12/2020, 14:15 - Olly: Done!
09/12/2020, 14:17 - Luke: 🤩
16/12/2020, 23:09 - Olly: Xmas themed scifi next week?
16/12/2020, 23:10 - Olly: With film this time, via technology
16/12/2020, 23:30 - Luke: Lol. I'm up for it. What Xmas scifi is there? The only one I remember is night of the comet
17/12/2020, 08:48 - Nathan: I'm in! I seem to remember Night of the comet was excellent. But quite recent I think. Does anyone have a record?
17/12/2020, 08:56 - Luke: Santa claus conquers the martians? https://www.giantfreakinrobot.com/scifi/scifi-movies-set-christmas.html

Though it's scores put it in unwatchable territory.
17/12/2020, 09:33 - Olly: This is sci fi afterall, unwatchable is it's middle name?
17/12/2020, 09:34 - Olly: I can do Wed?
17/12/2020, 09:34 - John Begley: Hahaha
17/12/2020, 09:35 - John Begley: I'm in
17/12/2020, 09:37 - Luke: Yeh Wednesday is good for me
17/12/2020, 09:48 - Nathan: Me too
17/12/2020, 09:48 - John Begley: Same
17/12/2020, 09:49 - Olly: You back in Blighty? Or a sicilian xmas?
17/12/2020, 09:52 - Nathan: Got back yesterday. Bit chilly isn't it?
17/12/2020, 09:56 - John Begley: It's been colder, sightly, but I think everyone is agreed that it's fairly mild so far.
17/12/2020, 09:57 - John Begley: Just shit compared to Siciliy
19/12/2020, 18:50 - Olly: <Media omitted>
19/12/2020, 18:51 - Olly: We may never be able to go out again, but at least I discovered the whatsapp gif search
19/12/2020, 18:52 - Olly: <Media omitted>
19/12/2020, 18:53 - Olly: <Media omitted>
19/12/2020, 19:44 - John Begley: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
19/12/2020, 19:45 - John Begley: Just went for a Xmas food shop now I'm not going to my parents. So much food. Most of it meat that Victoria can't eat
19/12/2020, 20:08 - Olly: Ha ha There's going to be a few xmas beef-cake people around come next week!
19/12/2020, 20:43 - Luke: 👌nice
21/12/2020, 15:08 - Olly: Has the video broadcast or synchronisation method for Wed been finalised?
21/12/2020, 15:37 - Luke: Are we planning anything fancier than zoom's share screen?
21/12/2020, 18:49 - Nathan: I actually can't make it.
21/12/2020, 19:16 - Olly: Wow. unexpected.
21/12/2020, 19:19 - John Begley: Curve ball
21/12/2020, 19:20 - Olly: I do hope everything is ok
22/12/2020, 07:47 - Nathan: Yeah, all ok thanks. Just a small change of plans. Will drop in to say Hi and check up on your video synchronisation accuracy
22/12/2020, 16:56 - Olly: We tried this and the video goes at 1 frame per second and audio is just as bad. Putting a tv in your camera view was better, but still unwatchable!
22/12/2020, 17:18 - John Begley: Hahaha
22/12/2020, 17:19 - John Begley: I think netflix on a laptop with the nexflix party thing but also with a phone power group video chat?
22/12/2020, 17:30 - Olly: Netflicks has a party mode? That sounds a sensible choice. Does everyone have a subscription though?
22/12/2020, 19:44 - John Begley: Boris Johnson is a Fucking Cunt (Single Edit) [Explicit] https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B08Q8S8JBD/ref=cm_sw_r_wa_apa_TXK4FbNX3J6PE
22/12/2020, 19:44 - John Begley: Make this Xmas number 1
22/12/2020, 19:44 - Nathan: Just bought it. Might even listen to it later.
22/12/2020, 19:44 - John Begley: Same
22/12/2020, 19:45 - John Begley: It will be so fucking good if it is Xmas number 1. Covid would almost be worth it
22/12/2020, 20:31 - Olly: Alexa has it. Listening to it now
22/12/2020, 22:03 - Luke: Lol, genius money making scheme. Oli, what's the verdict on actually listening to it?
22/12/2020, 22:04 - Olly: Simple but elegant
22/12/2020, 22:04 - John Begley: It's quite repeatative
22/12/2020, 22:04 - John Begley: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
23/12/2020, 14:39 - Olly: Incredibly, I've just realised that I'm also busy tonight. I forgot to put a previously paid-for online play in my calendar. Sorry guys :-(
23/12/2020, 15:04 - Luke: O cool, what's the play? 

And lets just rearrange for when more of us are free. I get the feeling we are going to be in tier 4 a while, so I'm sure we'll manage it at some point!
23/12/2020, 15:11 - Olly: Getting seasonal, watching A Christmas Carol tonight
24/12/2020, 07:17 - Olly: Scrooge was Egg it turns out. He was rather good!
25/12/2020, 14:14 - Nathan: Happy Christmas everyone. What is Egg?
25/12/2020, 14:18 - Luke: Happy Xmas! And I've been meaning to ask who Egg is for the last day
25/12/2020, 15:40 - Olly: As Beyonce would say, "if you like it then you should have put an egg on it", and indeed it did have an Egg
25/12/2020, 15:41 - Olly: Egg from "this life", if you remember that ancient series. He's better known for a famous zombie series nowadays though. He didn't play the zombie scrooge card though
25/12/2020, 15:42 - Olly: Ps happy Christmas
25/12/2020, 15:43 - Olly: Ive had "feliz navidad" in my head all day. Maybe the best xmas song? Controversial perhaps
25/12/2020, 15:51 - James A: Glad you asked this Nathan. I was confused but liked the sound of it anyway. Merry Christmas all!
30/12/2020, 12:31 - Nathan: Sci-fi tonight?
30/12/2020, 15:31 - Olly: I'm game. After dinner?
30/12/2020, 16:20 - Luke: Yeh, I'm up for it too. Whenever's good for me, as I can pause binge watching bad spanish dramas at any point
30/12/2020, 17:16 - Nathan: Brilliant. Probably about 2030 for me.
30/12/2020, 17:50 - Olly: Chat at 2030!
30/12/2020, 18:05 - John Begley: I'm in
30/12/2020, 19:18 - Olly: Do I need a netflicks login
30/12/2020, 19:43 - Nathan: Films, lol
30/12/2020, 20:05 - John Begley: Are we going to try to watch a film?
30/12/2020, 20:07 - John Begley: It's not been done successfully yet...
30/12/2020, 20:07 - Nathan: Let's discuss it and vote on whether to attempt it
30/12/2020, 20:11 - John Begley: There is an add-in called netflix party which you can download to synchronise the film. Then we would have to do a simultaneous WhatsApp call and where one earphone so we can hear both the shit film and the amazing chat about the shit film
30/12/2020, 20:11 - John Begley: Wear*

06/01/2021, 20:27 - Olly: CNN is pretty exciting at the moment 😟
06/01/2021, 20:44 - Luke: Fucking hell. Though seems disappointingly mellow. The only time I want to see some riot cops
06/01/2021, 20:51 - Olly: 🙂
06/01/2021, 21:07 - John Begley: 🤣
06/01/2021, 23:02 - Luke: <Media omitted>
06/01/2021, 23:03 - Nathan: Haha
07/01/2021, 06:37 - John Begley: Hahahahahaha
07/01/2021, 07:59 - Nathan: Still laughing
07/01/2021, 08:27 - Olly: When I saw that guy sitting in the Senate last night, for some reason I thought of you Nathan. I think it's the shirtlessness, plus facial expression perhaps
07/01/2021, 08:40 - James A: Ha!
07/01/2021, 10:47 - Dodo: <Media omitted>
07/01/2021, 10:49 - Olly: I knew it!
07/01/2021, 10:49 - Luke: Absolutely incredible 😂😂😂
07/01/2021, 10:50 - Luke: That guy was definitely missing your sunglasses. Would definitely have finished his outfit perfectly 👌
07/01/2021, 11:03 - Nathan: Oh wow
07/01/2021, 11:11 - Olly: Carrie LHAO 🤣
07/01/2021, 11:12 - Dodo: “What do you mean I can’t wear this inside??”
07/01/2021, 11:18 - James A: Amazing. I thought I couldn’t be cheered up but I was wrong!
07/01/2021, 12:26 - John Begley: This is fantastic. Might be a good t-shirt design
20/01/2021, 13:46 - Olly: No sci fi?
20/01/2021, 13:48 - Nathan: I'm free!
20/01/2021, 13:48 - John Begley: I'm in
20/01/2021, 13:48 - Luke: Uni :( but this is my penultimate week of evening classes, so I'll be back soon
20/01/2021, 13:51 - Olly: Anyone fancy scouring Netflix for sci fi, try to watch something synchronised on laptops, and have zoom on phones?
20/01/2021, 13:51 - Olly: I would do it, but I've procrastinated from work quite a bit today already
20/01/2021, 13:51 - John Begley: What about Spectral (2016)?
20/01/2021, 13:52 - John Begley: IMDB 6.3/Rotten tomatoes 75%
20/01/2021, 13:53 - John Begley: 107m runtime
20/01/2021, 13:53 - John Begley: Was looking for some classic Arnie, but there is none on Netflix
20/01/2021, 13:56 - Olly: I'm down. I did just do a quick search, and  apparently "class of 1999" is available. Robots and schools. 5.9 imdb.
20/01/2021, 13:56 - Olly: Is that a sequel to one we saw?
20/01/2021, 13:57 - Olly: Anyway, as long as we watch a bad film, we'll have plenty of time for conversion
20/01/2021, 13:57 - John Begley: Almost guaranteed
20/01/2021, 13:57 - Olly: *conversation. Or conversion I guess
20/01/2021, 13:59 - John Begley: This looks awesome but can't find it on netflix
20/01/2021, 14:00 - Olly: Damn, are you implying there is untruth on the internet
20/01/2021, 14:02 - Nathan: Does it really need to be on netflix? Class of 1999 looks perfect
20/01/2021, 14:06 - Nathan: Ahhh...we've watched it already.
20/01/2021, 14:07 - Nathan: Which means we haven't watched Class of 1984! but...it's not sci-fi
20/01/2021, 14:32 - Olly: Spectral is the unanimous winner then!
20/01/2021, 14:34 - Nathan: I vote rewatch of Class of 1999
20/01/2021, 14:37 - Olly: I can't download it since I got all those viruses. Or my computer did
20/01/2021, 14:41 - Nathan: ahh go on: https://www1.thepiratebay3.to/torrent/12424581/Class_Of_1999_Sci_Fi_Horror_1989_Eng_Subs_H246_mp4
20/01/2021, 15:48 - Olly: I gained significant extra forehead lines last time I downloaded something. It put me off
20/01/2021, 15:49 - John Begley: Can you download it Nathan and put it on google-drive?
20/01/2021, 15:50 - John Begley: If you share the folder we can download from there can't?
20/01/2021, 15:51 - Nathan: You guys should really learn how to use computers
20/01/2021, 15:51 - Olly: I'm to old these days
20/01/2021, 15:52 - Olly: *too
20/01/2021, 15:52 - Nathan: But it's 20 year old tech
20/01/2021, 15:55 - Olly: So is Bluetooth version 1. And don't say you can make that work!
20/01/2021, 15:59 - Nathan: Can you catch a virus from it?
20/01/2021, 16:01 - John Begley: On a different note Alice in Borderland on Netflix is good. Not a film so unsci-fiable. But it is scifi so everyone should watch it as homework
20/01/2021, 16:02 - Olly: Seeing as we're breaking all the rules, we could? Although I guess you have watched it?
20/01/2021, 16:03 - John Begley: Only the first episode. But it is subtitled and quite hard to watch unless you concentrate. Which is very unsci-fi.
20/01/2021, 16:10 - Nathan: I'll upload Class of 1999 for you. Just this once.
20/01/2021, 16:23 - Olly: Awesome. 8pmish start after dinner ok??
20/01/2021, 16:30 - Nathan: Yep, more like half 8 for me
20/01/2021, 16:33 - Olly: Cool
20/01/2021, 16:44 - John Begley: Cool

20/01/2021, 20:32 - Olly: It's tradition that Nathan stays the zoom?

20/01/2021, 20:43 - John Begley: Time.is
20/01/2021, 21:15 - John Begley: New meeting I'd?
20/01/2021, 21:15 - Nathan: No
20/01/2021, 21:17 - John Begley: How do we continue to talk?
20/01/2021, 21:18 - Olly: Join previous link
21/01/2021, 14:40 - John Begley: https://youtu.be/i7a8Od1Jlrg
21/01/2021, 14:44 - Nathan: It's crying out for a montage
21/01/2021, 14:54 - John Begley: Shall we do a montage of our failed online sci-fi nights to our successful one?
27/01/2021, 20:00 - Olly: <Media omitted>
27/01/2021, 20:09 - Luke: So good. This is why thinly slicing red cabbage is my favourite cooking task
27/01/2021, 20:26 - John Begley: Very scifi
02/02/2021, 08:48 - Olly: <Media omitted>
02/02/2021, 08:48 - Nathan: Haha. Love it.
02/02/2021, 08:49 - Nathan: Who's up for a sci-fi tomorrow? Luke, are you back this week? John and I were thinking of Robocop. But is that what you watched on the bus to Holland?
02/02/2021, 09:02 - Luke: O cool. Hopefully I can come as this weeks lectures are meant to be short 🤞haha, yeh it was one of the holland bus films, but that was a few years ago, so I'm up for it again
02/02/2021, 09:21 - Olly: I'm down
02/02/2021, 09:59 - Olly: Btw this is the name of my second band after hairy daughter break up due to religious differences
03/02/2021, 09:05 - Nathan: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1mhuXmTYMlpqjPs0pq0eDVcejLUo9SJ_c
03/02/2021, 15:44 - Olly: Cheers! What time, 8?
03/02/2021, 15:45 - Nathan: More like half eight for me
03/02/2021, 15:45 - Olly: Ok
03/02/2021, 18:02 - Luke: 👍
03/02/2021, 20:31 - Nathan: https://us04web.zoom.us/j/4239535685?pwd=Zml4WUxzNFB2NkRRYkxjd3d2QzN6UT09
03/02/2021, 21:11 - John Begley: Using my phones as a  hotspot I am up to 1gb downloaded. If I watch the the first half of the film at around 1.6, I should catch you guys up for the ending
03/02/2021, 21:11 - Luke: 😅
03/02/2021, 21:58 - John Begley: Can't get into the meeting
03/02/2021, 21:58 - Nathan: https://us04web.zoom.us/j/72099196703?pwd=U3hmZmpxcGdVK05LdFRvTHlDd3JKZz09
03/02/2021, 22:39 - Olly: Ok good sifi, see soon!
03/02/2021, 22:42 - Luke: 👋
03/02/2021, 22:42 - Nathan: Wooooo!
03/02/2021, 23:55 - John Begley: 🍾
04/02/2021, 14:03 - John Begley: <Media omitted>
04/02/2021, 14:03 - John Begley: My new speeds
04/02/2021, 14:06 - Luke: So good 🤩
04/02/2021, 14:07 - Luke: Why is open reach so shit
04/02/2021, 14:07 - John Begley: Hahaha
04/02/2021, 14:08 - John Begley: Their reign is over
04/02/2021, 15:07 - Luke: Hyperoptic is 👑
04/02/2021, 15:48 - Nathan: <Media omitted>
04/02/2021, 15:55 - Luke: 😅
04/02/2021, 16:00 - Nathan: Let me try that again...
04/02/2021, 16:00 - Nathan: <Media omitted>
04/02/2021, 16:01 - Luke: Much better pacing 👌 This scene may even work at below x1.0
04/02/2021, 16:32 - John Begley: 🤣🤣🤣
04/02/2021, 16:42 - Olly: He's sniffing it! Didn't realise that yesterday
04/02/2021, 17:00 - John Begley: It was very odd
04/02/2021, 17:28 - Luke: I think we have been distracted by how odd the finger dipping/sniffing is. But also doing large drug deals while drinking glasses of red wine, also very odd
04/02/2021, 17:55 - John Begley: 🤣🤣🤣
04/02/2021, 20:59 - Nathan: What should you be drinking during large drug deals? Wine feels natural to me, maybe champagne if it's a really big one.
04/02/2021, 21:15 - John Begley: I think neat vodka feels pretty russian gangsta to me.
04/02/2021, 21:38 - Nathan: Clarence was Russian?
04/02/2021, 21:38 - John Begley: Ha
04/02/2021, 21:40 - John Begley: <Media omitted>
06/02/2021, 11:34 - Luke: Meant to update, for those who thought a global pandemic would maybe improve hygiene standards in camberwell's takeaways. When I was in bolu this week they spilt salad onto some raw burgers, and then just put it back in the salad container 😬
06/02/2021, 14:03 - Olly: That should make me not want to go to bolu. But somehow I still wish I was there
06/02/2021, 14:29 - Luke: We then immediately ate burgers full of salad. So we weren't deterred
23/02/2021, 18:26 - Nathan: Sci-fi tomorrow?
23/02/2021, 18:58 - John Begley: I'm in
23/02/2021, 18:58 - John Begley: What film?
23/02/2021, 19:02 - Luke: Yeh, I'm up for it
23/02/2021, 19:07 - Nathan: Shall we vote?
23/02/2021, 19:29 - John Begley: ET?
23/02/2021, 20:14 - Luke: Not sure if this is a serious suggestion but I'm up for it 👍Izzy has been meaning to make me watch it for years, as I have never watched it
23/02/2021, 20:40 - John Begley: Yeah was serious. I don't think I've seen it since I was about 12. It's classic sci-fi
23/02/2021, 20:52 - Luke: Cool! Let's do it, unless nathan vetoes? Or has better options?
23/02/2021, 20:53 - Nathan: It's a bit...
23/02/2021, 20:54 - Nathan: but ok, do you need me to download it for you?
23/02/2021, 21:02 - Nathan: Actually, it feels wrong. How about Hackers?
23/02/2021, 21:45 - Luke: Haha, because it's a kids film?? Hackers has a good imdb:rotten tomato ratio, so I'm up for it too 🤷‍♂️
23/02/2021, 21:49 - John Begley: Happy either way too. Nathan has to download it too, so our chatter about which we prefer is just for show I think
23/02/2021, 21:52 - Nathan: Glad you understand
23/02/2021, 21:52 - Luke: 😅 good point
24/02/2021, 00:26 - Nathan: https://drive.google.com/file/d/12Qvn7FOQUYKnXSLmqKF2PuzGaFPZ6IxB/view?usp=sharing
24/02/2021, 06:28 - John Begley: 🤣🤣🤣
24/02/2021, 07:24 - Olly: Thank god Nathan is in charge and we aren't watching ET
24/02/2021, 07:27 - Olly: What time tonight? I need an early night after getting back into my habit this week of wearing myself out obsessing over a new design for a noise circuit
24/02/2021, 07:29 - Luke: Earlier is best for me too as I have an exam tomorrow
24/02/2021, 07:30 - John Begley: No difference for me happy for early
24/02/2021, 07:57 - Nathan: How's half 7?
24/02/2021, 08:12 - Olly: Perfect
24/02/2021, 08:47 - Luke: 👍
24/02/2021, 18:35 - Olly: What a whopper! 8.4gb
24/02/2021, 19:02 - Nathan: Oh yeah. Have you got it yet John?
24/02/2021, 19:06 - Luke: Because of HASL I have an unlimited zoom account

Passcode: 947778
24/02/2021, 19:07 - Luke: So we don't have to keep logging back in
24/02/2021, 19:10 - Nathan: Brilliant
24/02/2021, 19:11 - John Begley: Nope. Network issues
24/02/2021, 19:12 - John Begley: Keeps failing halfway through
24/02/2021, 19:12 - Luke: Shit, Hyperoptic didn't solve the issue then 😞
24/02/2021, 19:13 - John Begley: No. Scared that the initial speeds were part of well coordinated con
24/02/2021, 19:14 - Luke: Haha, yeh I had same sensation, but it is still so much better than what I had before, so I am happily conned
24/02/2021, 19:17 - Nathan: John, just shared it with you via gdrive so it should be syncable. Everyone else got it?
24/02/2021, 19:18 - Luke: Yep 👍
24/02/2021, 22:04 - Nathan: "The interior scenes for the Cyberdelia nightclub were filmed at the disused Brentford Public Baths"
24/02/2021, 22:11 - Luke: O cool. Pretty impressive they travelled so far just for the nightclub scenes 👌
24/02/2021, 22:12 - Luke: <Media omitted>
24/02/2021, 22:14 - Luke: Turns out I do not know how to use gifs 🥴
24/02/2021, 22:14 - John Begley: 🤣🤣
24/02/2021, 22:14 - John Begley: I liked it
24/02/2021, 22:16 - Luke: Haha, cheers
09/03/2021, 14:57 - Nathan: Sci-fi tomorrow?
10/03/2021, 08:44 - Luke: Sorry, had lots of intense evening zoom calls in last few days and want a break!
10/03/2021, 09:45 - Olly: This week has been call intensive for me too. But next week I'm well up for it
10/03/2021, 09:45 - John Begley: Same
17/03/2021, 07:55 - Olly: Sifi?
17/03/2021, 08:14 - Nathan: only a maybe for me
17/03/2021, 08:28 - John Begley: A no from me unfortunately. Next week though I'm in
30/03/2021, 23:42 - Nathan: Sci-fi?
31/03/2021, 06:45 - Luke: 👍
31/03/2021, 07:26 - Olly: Yep
14/04/2021, 19:43 - Luke: https://youtu.be/Np_RMEQnCb4
14/04/2021, 20:20 - Olly: Cool. Is it good?
14/04/2021, 20:30 - Luke: Ermm, i'm enjoying it because it makes me nostalgic for scifi night films 🤷‍♂️ Also a disaster distopia based in sheffield is kind of fun
15/04/2021, 10:11 - Olly: Sounds great!
15/04/2021, 10:13 - Luke: If you do watch it, if you can explain to me any basis for the acid rain, that would be great!
15/04/2021, 10:20 - John Begley: Hahahaha
15/04/2021, 10:39 - Olly: Whatever did happen to acid rain I wonder. Did we fix it, or was it a nonsense?
15/04/2021, 11:08 - Luke: Good question! Looks like it got solved

https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190823-can-lessons-from-acid-rain-help-stop-climate-change
15/04/2021, 11:43 - Olly: Wow why don't people talk about this success story to demonstrate how nations can work together to solve climate issues?
15/04/2021, 12:42 - Nathan: Fixing the ozone hole is an even better example.
15/04/2021, 13:07 - Luke: Yeh, Izzy says this is the example used in the climate policy parts of geography degrees/alevels. Institutional favouritism to big ozone
01/06/2021, 19:01 - Nathan: Anyone around tomorrow evening?
02/06/2021, 10:04 - Luke: Sorry, cannot do tonight, we have an urgent HASL protest tomorrow. Up for it next week though if weather still good
02/06/2021, 10:40 - Olly: Deff up for next week. But have to do lots of nonsense tonight 😞
08/06/2021, 10:38 - Nathan: Tomorrow evening then?

10/06/2021, 15:58 - John Begley: Cheers!
10/06/2021, 19:50 - Luke: So good! Cheers for sending. Tbh that is way above the quality I was expecting for a family short story competition
10/06/2021, 21:19 - John Begley: Haha, ta, I'll try and find my nan's. I reckon that would readdress the balance
10/06/2021, 21:21 - Luke: Yes!
12/06/2021, 16:28 - You removed Dodo
12/06/2021, 18:12 - You added Dodo

14/06/2021, 19:14 - John Begley: Bit more of the old reconnecting I imagine...
14/06/2021, 20:10 - Luke: 🤣
15/06/2021, 14:36 - Nathan: I'm busy next week. And the week after that is too far away to begin thinking about.

13/07/2021, 22:18 - Nathan: Sci-fi?

14/07/2021, 06:20 - Luke: 😂 it took me a worrying amount of time to get this 😬
14/07/2021, 06:21 - Luke: Yeh! I'll pop along to the outdoor bit
14/07/2021, 06:37 - John Begley: Yep
14/07/2021, 06:37 - John Begley: To this
14/07/2021, 08:13 - Olly: Had my 2nd vaccine yesterday - so far so good, so I'm a tentative yes
14/07/2021, 08:14 - John Begley: 🤯
14/07/2021, 09:03 - You added Spam
14/07/2021, 09:04 - Spam: The five week suspension is over!
14/07/2021, 09:09 - Nathan: Let that be a lesson to us all
14/07/2021, 09:11 - Spam: Don’t attend, don’t contribute and you will get suspended!... but not for too long?
14/07/2021, 09:40 - Nathan: For a first time offender
14/07/2021, 09:45 - Olly: Beware, for the 2nd offence the five week suspension will be literal
14/07/2021, 12:10 - Luke: Lol! I am very happy to see that sci-fi night is finally putting sentencing guidelines in place
14/07/2021, 15:13 - John Begley: Hey, going to have to withdraw my "yes" to sci-fi night, on account of Victorias broken foot I need to make dinner and stuff. I fully accept that this could result in the standard 5 week ban.
14/07/2021, 16:33 - You removed John Begley
14/07/2021, 17:19 - Olly: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
14/07/2021, 17:25 - Olly: I'm afraid my tentative has manifested as a "no"  due to a mediocre level of post-vaccine misery.  I appoint Luke to be my representative in any upcoming legal challenges related
15/07/2021, 12:57 - You added John Begley
15/07/2021, 12:59 - Nathan: Sentence reduced for long service and a clean prior record
15/07/2021, 13:12 - Luke: Did you not consider his previous rocket league night conviction as an aggravating factor?
15/07/2021, 13:13 - Spam: John does have a lifetime ban from RL nights, much harsher sentencing for those
15/07/2021, 13:19 - John Begley: Hahaha
18/07/2021, 18:57 - Nathan: Sci-fi on Wednesday? It's looking warm and it's (almost) my birthday.
18/07/2021, 22:18 - Olly: Yes I'm in
18/07/2021, 22:53 - Luke: 👍
20/07/2021, 07:03 - John Begley: I am also in.
21/07/2021, 16:44 - Luke: This still happening? Camberwell green?
21/07/2021, 16:44 - Nathan: Yeah! What time?
21/07/2021, 16:44 - Luke: 5.45 🤷‍♂️
21/07/2021, 16:52 - Nathan: Cool
21/07/2021, 16:52 - Nathan: Too hot for games I think
21/07/2021, 17:00 - Olly: I'll be 6:16
21/07/2021, 17:21 - Olly: I mean 6:25
21/07/2021, 17:25 - Nathan: Thanks for the update
21/07/2021, 17:40 - John Begley: I am on the green
28/07/2021, 19:40 - Nathan: Anyone wanna go and see 2046 at the BFI on Sunday at 1530? Meant to be quite bad.
28/07/2021, 19:50 - John Begley: I'm in
28/07/2021, 21:50 - Nathan: Are you sure? Might be only about 10% sci-fi. If so, I'll get tickets.
28/07/2021, 21:50 - John Begley: I read the blurb. It sounds amazing.
28/07/2021, 21:51 - John Begley: I'm in. Full partner.
28/07/2021, 21:51 - Nathan: Brilliant
04/08/2021, 08:36 - Nathan: Sci-fi?
04/08/2021, 09:00 - Olly: <Media omitted>
04/08/2021, 09:03 - John Begley: Oh. Very sorry to hear she has died. Hope you and Carrie are doing ok. Great picture there
04/08/2021, 09:26 - Luke: Really sorry to hear but that is a brilliant photo. Hope you both are doing alright.
04/08/2021, 09:50 - James A: Ah sorry to hear that ☹️Hope you’re both ok
04/08/2021, 10:03 - Nathan: Ah, sorry Olly. She was truly an all-skiing, all-mountain climbing hero doge. Will drink and consume cheese to her memory this evening.
04/08/2021, 10:24 - Olly: Cheers guys, appreciate it
25/08/2021, 15:53 - Olly: No sci-fi tonight?
25/08/2021, 16:06 - Nathan: Not tonight, sorry. Next week?
25/08/2021, 16:51 - Olly: Flying to US next week, so maybe 15 Sep
25/08/2021, 17:56 - Nathan: Cool. Should be on for the 15th.
21/09/2021, 20:10 - Nathan: Sci-fi tomorrow?
21/09/2021, 23:10 - Olly: Yes let's do it!
22/09/2021, 06:44 - John Begley: I'm in
22/09/2021, 13:49 - Olly: My arrival time will be exactly 18:15:00
22/09/2021, 14:01 - Nathan: And departure time?
22/09/2021, 14:03 - John Begley: He's already left
22/09/2021, 14:08 - Olly: Estimated time of departure from your house is 18:17:57
22/09/2021, 14:10 - John Begley: Hahaha
22/09/2021, 17:10 - Olly: A conundrum for you: Is it legal to wear hats in some pubs after 8pm?
22/09/2021, 17:13 - John Begley: No?
22/09/2021, 17:59 - Nathan: Let's try it.
05/10/2021, 09:05 - Nathan: Sci-fi tomorrow?
05/10/2021, 10:02 - Olly: Yeppy-do-da-day
05/10/2021, 10:05 - John Begley: Can't I'm afraid
05/10/2021, 20:34 - Luke: Yeh!
06/10/2021, 11:45 - Olly: Consider my offer of attendance this evening rescinded
06/10/2021, 11:46 - Olly: (Apologies, some stuff has come up 😔)
06/10/2021, 11:55 - Nathan: No worries. Next time!
12/10/2021, 09:54 - Nathan: Sci-fi tomorrow?
12/10/2021, 13:07 - Luke: Yeh!
12/10/2021, 23:06 - Olly: Sorry not tomorrow - see you next week
13/10/2021, 00:16 - Nathan: Yeah, hopefully, although also hoping to be on holiday.
13/10/2021, 00:17 - Nathan: Sorry Luke, probably going to cancel tomorrow, think I'm coming down with the cold finally.
13/10/2021, 09:04 - Luke: No worries, hope you get better soon!
01/11/2021, 15:23 - Olly: Is there sci fi this week? I'm hoping so as can't do following week I think
01/11/2021, 20:06 - Nathan: Yeah, let's do it
01/11/2021, 21:09 - Olly: 🤯
02/11/2021, 07:31 - John Begley: I'm in
02/11/2021, 07:39 - Luke: Me too
03/11/2021, 09:26 - John Begley: https://open.spotify.com/track/5bt2BVvXQwQtALXameCCOI?si=G5GmQQlZT02ucabesrhIyA&utm_source=whatsapp
03/11/2021, 17:23 - Nathan: Tick tock
03/11/2021, 17:25 - Olly: On train, be there 630pm 03/11/2021
03/11/2021, 17:31 - Olly: Train very stationary. I may have underestimated the date of arrival...
03/11/2021, 17:42 - John Begley: Hahaha
09/11/2021, 21:41 - Nathan: Sci-fi tomorrow?
09/11/2021, 22:39 - Luke: Yeh, why not
10/11/2021, 07:12 - Olly: I cannee make it Captain. The subspace drive is too small.
10/11/2021, 07:13 - Olly: (I need 6 weeks to fix it, but if you say that I have 2 weeks, that'll be fine as I always overinflate my estimates by a factor of 3)
10/11/2021, 07:19 - Olly: Damn it, I should have said "too wee"?
10/11/2021, 07:22 - John Begley: Hahaha
10/11/2021, 10:10 - Olly: That's the last time I go to all the effort of making up a bad star-trek joke if there's not going to be a single ha about my subspace drive comment
10/11/2021, 10:10 - John Begley: Hahahaha
10/11/2021, 10:10 - Olly: I should have never written the bit in brackets. Mia culpa
10/11/2021, 10:13 - Nathan: I've been thinking about it all morning.
10/11/2021, 10:14 - Nathan: I know Luke has too.
10/11/2021, 10:14 - Nathan: We just don't know what to say
10/11/2021, 10:15 - John Begley: Surely this discussion about the comment beats a single "haha"?
10/11/2021, 10:16 - Nathan: Does it mean there are engineering works on the train reducing its capacity for a while?
10/11/2021, 10:17 - Olly: I'm glad everyone is seeing how very witty I am, after all
10/11/2021, 10:18 - Olly: Nope. I was just thinking a lot about the size of subspace in the shower this morning
10/11/2021, 10:20 - Olly: Not the size of the subspace specifically in my shower though, more generally, and most importantly when applied to science fiction
10/11/2021, 10:21 - Nathan: Ok. Like whether you could fit an entire world inside a proton if you folded it carefully?
10/11/2021, 10:24 - Olly: A little bit about that, but mainly just the thought of how big a subspace drive is really is, and whether it can be too small. That was food for thought enough at 630 this morning
10/11/2021, 10:26 - Olly: I wonder if Sam and James are still listening these days? They could really be missing out
10/11/2021, 10:26 - Spam: Im always listening
10/11/2021, 10:27 - Nathan: Absolutely terrifying
10/11/2021, 10:27 - John Begley: The speed of reply is a scary part
10/11/2021, 10:27 - John Begley: It can't be a joke
10/11/2021, 10:30 - Olly: Blimey!
10/11/2021, 12:05 - James A: Yeah same. Got a bit distracted with work there, but that’s only temporary
10/11/2021, 16:52 - Olly: I'm impressed!
23/11/2021, 10:28 - Olly: What's the chances of a sci fi tomorrow?
23/11/2021, 10:29 - Olly: (I've got some important food best-before-date issues to contemplate upon)
23/11/2021, 10:36 - Nathan: Very unlikely for me. Not due back until Monday.
23/11/2021, 12:47 - Olly: Roast chicken Wednesday it is then! I hope holiday is treating you well
23/11/2021, 13:11 - Luke: I feel this so much
23/11/2021, 13:14 - Olly: 🤣🤣
24/11/2021, 09:38 - Spam: Rebecca really enjoyed your joke John, even without any context
24/11/2021, 09:39 - John Begley: As we said, a hollow victory when in my heart, I have no respect for puns...
24/11/2021, 09:39 - John Begley: I will try it on Victoria though. See how it goes down
24/11/2021, 11:36 - Luke: We can't have meta joke chat, leaving us waiting. Come on John?
24/11/2021, 12:21 - John Begley: Sam removed a leaf from the pitch and I said that it "could have been leafal". It doesn't bare repeating.
24/11/2021, 12:22 - John Begley: Or bear repeating? Both seem odd.
24/11/2021, 13:22 - Luke: Pretty good 😂 Personally into puns, and also health and safety ⛑️ it covered all bases
24/11/2021, 13:23 - John Begley: 😀
24/11/2021, 14:28 - Nathan: Only a slight anticlimax in my opinion. Would love to hear more about its reception on the night though?
24/11/2021, 14:57 - John Begley: It's was for Sam's ears only, and we general discussed not enjoying puns that much.
25/11/2021, 20:32 - Olly: Due to the sci fi night cancellation, I would recommend this homework to those keen: watch the short documentary film "Clouds are not Spheres" on Netflix. Excellent in many ways, but mainly because of the computer graphics
25/11/2021, 20:34 - John Begley: 👍
29/11/2021, 08:43 - Olly: Pre-omicron lockdown sci-fi on Wed?
29/11/2021, 08:49 - Nathan: Should be on! I don't think we're meant to be self-isolating, but I'm not totally sure.
30/11/2021, 20:39 - Luke: Forgot about this. Yeh I'm up for it if it is happening!
30/11/2021, 20:43 - John Begley: I'm in
30/11/2021, 20:45 - Nathan: Yeah, me too.
30/11/2021, 21:04 - Olly: And me
30/11/2021, 21:09 - John Begley: From what time?
30/11/2021, 21:19 - Nathan: Think I have a meeting till 6
30/11/2021, 21:19 - John Begley: Shame
30/11/2021, 21:21 - Nathan: Actually, I'm wrong, it's only till 5.
30/11/2021, 21:22 - John Begley: That's better. I was thinking of bringing the scooter back, but I would want to leave at 4. Because I am scared of rush hour traffic
01/12/2021, 17:22 - Olly: Running late, be there at 7
01/12/2021, 17:43 - Olly: Maybe 640
01/12/2021, 20:15 - Olly: <Media omitted>
01/12/2021, 20:15 - Olly: <Media omitted>
07/12/2021, 17:25 - John Begley: Sci fi on tomorrow?
07/12/2021, 17:26 - Nathan: Yes
07/12/2021, 17:26 - John Begley: I'm in
08/12/2021, 09:02 - Nathan: Meet in the Tiger?
08/12/2021, 09:30 - John Begley: The only pub in camberwell
08/12/2021, 13:45 - Olly: Won't be over this time I'm afraid. Have a goodn!
21/12/2021, 13:38 - John Begley: <Media omitted>

23/12/2021, 18:24 - Luke: <Media omitted>
23/12/2021, 18:45 - John Begley: I've got a good feeling about E
23/12/2021, 18:45 - Nathan: Damn, I was gonna take E
23/12/2021, 18:46 - Nathan: I'll have I instead
23/12/2021, 18:52 - Luke: Interesting choices. Going for the ones that stand out 👌 They are both much older than the rest and E recently fell into a washing up bowl...but maybe that makes batteries stronger 🤷‍♂️ we'll find out 🤓
23/12/2021, 19:13 - John Begley: No
23/12/2021, 19:17 - John Begley: Damn
23/12/2021, 19:18 - Luke: 😂 sorry John
23/12/2021, 20:33 - Luke: B, D and H are out!
23/12/2021, 20:34 - Luke: E and I still looking strong
23/12/2021, 20:39 - John Begley: Hahaha
23/12/2021, 21:01 - Luke: F just went too. Dropping like flies
23/12/2021, 21:10 - John Begley: Can we have a new photo? I'm having trouble visualising the state of play
23/12/2021, 21:14 - Luke: <Media omitted>
23/12/2021, 21:16 - Luke: I checked the battery life of them new, and it is 6 hours. So we are over half way through. From here on it's going to be like take me out when the man is over 50
23/12/2021, 21:16 - Luke: E just went! Sorry John. It did surprisingly well
23/12/2021, 23:03 - Luke: <Media omitted>
23/12/2021, 23:37 - John Begley: I had a good run
23/12/2021, 23:38 - John Begley: After the washing machine I'm hardly surprised
23/12/2021, 23:38 - Nathan: Yeah, not bad. What time are we starting tomorrow?
24/12/2021, 06:49 - Luke: Yeh I didn't think it would last an hour after that.
24/12/2021, 06:50 - Luke: I've got work sadly. So probably some point in the evening when I am watching Korean dramas and can easily keep an eye on them.
24/12/2021, 07:19 - Nathan: Probably the most exciting Christmas Eve in 30 years
24/12/2021, 08:05 - Luke: Haha, it's going to be a good one
24/12/2021, 08:52 - Luke: <Media omitted>
24/12/2021, 08:53 - John Begley: Hahaha
24/12/2021, 08:53 - John Begley: To play there kunts and the gang Spotify playlist on repeat constantly
24/12/2021, 09:40 - Nathan: I think it's too late to help the number one effort now. But it's actually a very good song in its own right. Worth listening to a few thousand times today.
24/12/2021, 09:41 - John Begley: Poor Kunt. He deserved it
24/12/2021, 09:54 - Nathan: Has he definitely lost?
24/12/2021, 09:54 - John Begley: Don't know. You said it was over and I assumed you would have said if he won
24/12/2021, 09:55 - Nathan: It's not officially announced until this evening. But the deadline for listen counts was midnight last night
24/12/2021, 09:56 - John Begley: Ah. Well fingers crossed. I played his playlist on repeat a few days last week with my volume down
24/12/2021, 13:57 - Luke: What a shame! Finally listened to it, and it's actually surprisingly good punk. Verses were always overrated anyway
24/12/2021, 13:57 - Luke: Haha nice 👌
24/12/2021, 19:58 - Luke: <Media omitted>
24/12/2021, 20:00 - John Begley: I'm going to plump for A. Just to make it more interesting for me
24/12/2021, 20:01 - Nathan: Also, I isn't available
24/12/2021, 20:03 - Luke: Good choice! I's low battery light has been flashing a while
24/12/2021, 20:06 - Luke: They are now past the brand new estimated battery life. So the only conclusion is these two guys have got stronger with time 💪 absolute warriors
24/12/2021, 20:06 - John Begley: I know I originally chose E, but I always had a soft spot for A.
24/12/2021, 20:08 - Luke: 😂
24/12/2021, 20:11 - John Begley: Also that proper cunt Ladbaby beat the Kunts
24/12/2021, 20:13 - Luke: 😞 what's wrong with this country
24/12/2021, 20:26 - Luke: <Media omitted>
24/12/2021, 20:27 - Luke: 6.5 hours and no signs of fading 🙌
24/12/2021, 20:28 - John Begley: 🤯
24/12/2021, 20:29 - John Begley: I can't pretend the victory doesn't feel a bit hollow.
24/12/2021, 20:36 - Nathan: Congrats. You deserve it. Can we do this every year?
24/12/2021, 20:37 - John Begley: It can be a new tradition, and respect
24/12/2021, 20:38 - Luke: Lol
24/12/2021, 20:41 - Luke: Soooo the whole point of this was cull to crowd. B, D, E, F and H are going in the bin. Sorry to expose the cruel underbelly of bike light racing
24/12/2021, 20:48 - Nathan: So long as there's a decent intake for next season
24/12/2021, 20:54 - John Begley: 🤣
24/12/2021, 21:04 - Luke: Heartless. I like it. I'll get working on it
30/12/2021, 12:51 - Olly: I am sad I missed the whole bike light game, but it gives me something to look forward to for 2022.
30/12/2021, 12:51 - Olly: I did however watch a noteworthy film that I really should have saved for sci fi: "don't look up"
30/12/2021, 12:52 - Olly: Sorry for that. But it might have been to good to be played at sci fi night anyway
30/12/2021, 20:18 - Nathan: I just watched it. Looking forward to the sequel.
04/01/2022, 20:26 - Luke: Haha, yeh Izzy enjoyed it, which I think is a sign it was way too good for sci-fi night
04/01/2022, 20:30 - Luke: Haha cheers! I think you'll all be happy to know that I did some random sampling to check the results and they were pretty reproducible 👌
04/01/2022, 21:44 - Olly: You're a scientist at heart!
16/01/2022, 17:49 - Olly: Is sci fi on this Wednesday? Fitter, happy, healthier, more productive for 2022?
16/01/2022, 17:57 - Nathan: No, sorry. Sci-fi will be back on the 2nd Feb.
16/01/2022, 22:43 - Olly: Ok see you guys then!
22/01/2022, 22:40 - Olly: I just saw the new matrix film. I'm not sure I understood any aspect of the plot.
22/01/2022, 22:48 - John Begley: It was a devious plot by the producers to drain the last bit of cash from the matrix cow
26/01/2022, 07:50 - John Begley: https://clickhole.com/are-you-a-boob-man-or-an-alligator-guy/
29/01/2022, 18:06 - Olly: Off genre, but this AI generated film is even better than the AI generated sci fi film. Glad to see AI is improving in hilarity
29/01/2022, 18:06 - Olly: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZzbxNoMjGM
30/01/2022, 11:34 - Luke: 😂 is that really AI generated? I am slightly worried if I find computers this funny
30/01/2022, 11:58 - Olly: He stabbed the consequence button
30/01/2022, 12:00 - John Begley: The detective trips because he is mostly whisky
30/01/2022, 12:06 - Olly: The co-worker lines are my favorite
30/01/2022, 12:42 - Luke: Whale cop
01/02/2022, 12:22 - Nathan: Sci-fi tomorrow?
01/02/2022, 12:22 - John Begley: Yes please
01/02/2022, 13:44 - Luke: Yeh, why not
01/02/2022, 17:05 - Olly: I'll be there
02/02/2022, 17:16 - Olly: Arriving 18:11
02/02/2022, 17:18 - Nathan: Departing?
02/02/2022, 17:21 - Olly: 18:17
02/02/2022, 17:23 - Nathan: Cool. We can watch that AI written film.
02/02/2022, 17:23 - John Begley: Hahahaha
02/02/2022, 17:58 - Luke: Sorry going to be a bit after Oli, a client keeps changing his mind 😞
09/02/2022, 07:39 - Nathan: Sci-fi?
09/02/2022, 13:33 - Luke: Sorry, don't think I can tonight. Chores and watching the snowboarding 😞😁
09/02/2022, 14:59 - Olly: Me neither, have a visitor
09/02/2022, 14:59 - Olly: (Though I'd much prefer to sci fi)
09/02/2022, 14:59 - John Begley: No me. Sorry
09/02/2022, 15:00 - Olly: Succinct
09/02/2022, 15:00 - Olly: 🤣
09/02/2022, 15:00 - John Begley: Hahaha
09/02/2022, 16:44 - Nathan: Probably just Sam, James and me tonight then
09/02/2022, 16:45 - John Begley: 😆
09/02/2022, 17:41 - Luke: Lol!
09/02/2022, 19:03 - James A: Ah… about that… 😬
22/02/2022, 22:20 - Nathan: Sci-fi tomorrow?
22/02/2022, 22:21 - Luke: Sorry, in Wolverhampton 😞
22/02/2022, 22:45 - John Begley: I'm in
22/02/2022, 23:20 - Olly: Not this time I'm afraid. Have fun. And no McPlant until next time
15/03/2022, 09:44 - Nathan: Anyone around for sci-fi tomorrow?
15/03/2022, 11:24 - Luke: Yeh!
15/03/2022, 16:47 - Nathan: Supernormal tickets go on sale tonight at 7. Anyone coming?
15/03/2022, 20:52 - Luke: Shit, did not see this in time. Did you get any tickets? Just looked now and they are all sold out
15/03/2022, 21:20 - Nathan: Tried and failed. Sold out in under a minute.
15/03/2022, 22:02 - Luke: 😮 when did supernormal become so popular
22/03/2022, 19:23 - Nathan: Any sci-fiers tomorrow?
23/03/2022, 06:32 - John Begley: Sorry I have an interview tomorrow and need to make a presentation about some stuff
23/03/2022, 06:33 - John Begley: https://www.superrecognisers.com/take-part
23/03/2022, 06:34 - John Begley: But here's a good thing to see how good you are at recognising faces.
23/03/2022, 07:15 - Luke: Good luck John!
23/03/2022, 07:15 - Luke: Yeh!
23/03/2022, 07:16 - Olly: Good luck John! I'm looking forward to my bad score at recognising.
23/03/2022, 07:17 - Olly: I think I have hayfever, but very similar symptoms to covid
23/03/2022, 09:37 - Olly: Pretty sure it's hayfever, but will not come over today
23/03/2022, 10:48 - Nathan: 9/14. I'm not super.
23/03/2022, 10:49 - Nathan: Yeah, good luck with the interview and the hayfever. See you later Luke. I'm at work (!) probably home 6ish.
23/03/2022, 11:03 - Luke: 8. Tbh, about halfway through everyone started to look the same and I was just guessing
23/03/2022, 11:03 - Luke: Cool, see you then!
23/03/2022, 11:04 - Luke: Yeh, they are super similar. I have spent the last two summers in a constant state of confusion about this
29/03/2022, 20:21 - Nathan: Who's around tomorrow?
29/03/2022, 20:24 - John Begley: I'm in
29/03/2022, 20:36 - Luke: Me too
29/03/2022, 21:16 - Olly: I'm on
30/03/2022, 16:51 - Nathan: ETAs?
30/03/2022, 16:52 - John Begley: Leaving now, is that a good idea?
30/03/2022, 16:52 - Nathan: Yeah
30/03/2022, 16:53 - Olly: Leaving now, is that a good idea?
30/03/2022, 16:54 - Olly: Remind me about the di-jean when I arrive
30/03/2022, 17:01 - Nathan: Haha ok!
06/04/2022, 23:02 - Luke: <Media omitted>
07/04/2022, 06:36 - John Begley: It's beautiful
07/04/2022, 06:38 - James A: 😍Wow!! I think I recognise some
07/04/2022, 07:00 - Nathan: That's lovely. Do you know where it is? Is it in jonathan nunn's house?
07/04/2022, 07:12 - Luke: So his Instagram always has an incredibly frustrating low level of detail. But I think based on his previous post that this is maybe from an exhibition in Lewisham shopping centre  🤷‍♂️ but really not sure.
07/04/2022, 07:12 - Luke: That would be incredible if it was his house!
07/04/2022, 07:20 - Dodo: It is! And it opens this Saturday. Mi-Fi night?
07/04/2022, 08:52 - Luke: O cool. Yeh I'm up for some mifi some time soon
20/04/2022, 10:01 - Nathan: Sci-fi?
20/04/2022, 10:35 - Olly: Still recovering from the bank holiday weekend I'm afraid!
20/04/2022, 11:28 - Luke: Yeh!
20/04/2022, 11:47 - Nathan: If anyone is interested in Supernormal festival this year (and maybe even if you're not) could you register for the ticket lottery please?
20/04/2022, 13:05 - Luke: Cool, doing this now. How many tickets should I put in for? 4?
20/04/2022, 13:06 - Nathan: Thanks! Yeah, 4.
20/04/2022, 15:14 - John Begley: Don't think I can make sci fi night
20/04/2022, 15:18 - Olly: I've entered the lottery for 4 tickets. Perhaps you should consider making a bot to do this, like everyone else has
20/04/2022, 15:20 - Olly: Then there can be wars of the bots over tickets. Queue laser sounds
20/04/2022, 16:13 - Nathan: Cheers Olly. Will develop the bot swarm tomorrow.
20/04/2022, 16:19 - Olly: With lasers?
20/04/2022, 16:59 - Nathan: Probably with a very high-level scripting language
20/04/2022, 17:08 - John Begley: Done it. What if we all win?
20/04/2022, 17:09 - John Begley: I'm not sure I know 16 people that want to go to this festival
20/04/2022, 20:43 - Nathan: Best course of action is probably just to buy the amount that we actually want.
24/04/2022, 08:27 - Luke: Me and Nathan were chatting about maybe trying some mountain biking and we thought other sci-fi ppl may be interested. There is a good looking mountain bike centre near London (an hour train from waterloo), and mountain bike hire for a half day is £35 for the basic bike. I've never been here before, but looks similar to trails near wolverhampton and the red trails there used to be really fun. Heres a link:

https://www.swinleybikehub.com/

Also, there is the old Olympic course in essex. But it has a lot of black features we have to avoid 😬
https://www.hadleighparkcycles.co.uk/cycling-in-the-park

Let us know if you're interested!
24/04/2022, 09:17 - Nathan: I'm interested in what you're saying
24/04/2022, 10:13 - Olly: Yeah I could happily give it a go, as long as it's not too busy or scary. I am fine on a mountain bike, but for the minor issue of not being capable of turning around corners
24/04/2022, 10:26 - Luke: Cool! So the one I've been in before is never that busy and you can just pause at the top of each downhill section to make sure it is quiet, and can go at a pace you feel comfortable. Lol, the not turning could be a bit more of an issue....but then in my experience most corners are banked anyway, so they kind of turn you...maybe 🤷‍♂️
24/04/2022, 10:36 - John Begley: I'm in. Bi-fi?
24/04/2022, 11:56 - Luke: This could get a bit misinterpreted, but I'm still up for it
24/04/2022, 11:56 - Olly: 🤣
24/04/2022, 12:16 - John Begley: Cy-fi. It was staring us in the face
24/04/2022, 12:21 - Luke: Haha, nice
26/04/2022, 08:52 - Nathan: Olly and I are going to The Blackfriar for sci-fi tomorrow. Anyone else wanna come?
26/04/2022, 09:56 - John Begley: I'll be across the river at my own leaving do
26/04/2022, 09:56 - John Begley: My pop over after
26/04/2022, 20:47 - Luke: I'm still not yet going indoors to pubs/restaurants, and looks like will be too cold tomorrow for outdoors 🥶So will give it a miss. but hopefully catch you soon Olly
26/04/2022, 22:41 - Olly: See soon!
27/04/2022, 12:26 - Nathan: Free drinks? We might pop over first
27/04/2022, 12:28 - John Begley: Hahaha, probably free drinks for me, but I'm not sure my colleagues will buy you drinks. You'll be effectively leaving Trinity after only a few minutes
01/05/2022, 08:53 - Luke: For cy-fi folk, here is a doodle to find a date
https://doodle.com/meeting/participate/id/epYo8pma

Ignore the time on the options, I just had to give a time.
01/05/2022, 11:52 - James A: Forgot to reply to this - I’m up for it in principle, especially if there’s bikes for hire (mine is more suited to roads / tow paths). Not sure about dates in May yet as got other stuff on, but I’ll keep an eye on what you guys decide. The Swinley one is out towards me, which I didn’t realise originally
01/05/2022, 12:26 - Luke: Cool! That would be great if you're free. I was thinking of pushing for the swinley one anyway, so works well.
02/05/2022, 11:50 - Olly: I've looked at my calendar and most may and June weekends are either booked up or I'm in usa for. So maybe I'll skip this one and join cy-fi2 "the return" instead?
02/05/2022, 21:03 - Luke: No worries Oli, and if it is good enough for a cy-fi2 (or if cy-fi1 falls apart and gets delayed) then would be great if you could come!
02/05/2022, 21:04 - Luke: Hey everyone, HASL has an email campaign in support of a severely overcrowded family who are having to go to the high court this Thursday to try and get social housing from Southwark council. It would be great if you could support it!

The family have faced horrific treatment from the council over the last 4 years and instead of supporting the family, the council have continually blamed them for the housing crisis and refused to help

The link to send the automated email is below and it takes 30 seconds to send. Also no need to live in Southwark, just the more emails the better. Also please share the link with anyone else you think maybe interested in sending an email

Thanks for any support with this! 

https://actionnetwork.org/letters/stop-blaming-overcrowded-families-for-the-housing-crisis
03/05/2022, 08:06 - Olly: Done!
03/05/2022, 08:09 - Luke: Amazing, cheers!
03/05/2022, 08:09 - John Begley: Also done
03/05/2022, 08:10 - Luke: 👍 ace, thanks John!
03/05/2022, 21:27 - Nathan: Sci-fi?
03/05/2022, 23:04 - Olly: Yep
04/05/2022, 13:22 - Luke: I will pop by for a bit, but then need to go do some HASL stuff
04/05/2022, 14:11 - Olly: Sorry, false alarm, staying at home tonight afterall
04/05/2022, 14:12 - Olly: Just don't HASL the Hoff
31/05/2022, 08:04 - Nathan: Sci-fi tomorrow?
31/05/2022, 08:05 - John Begley: Yep
31/05/2022, 08:15 - Luke: 👍
31/05/2022, 09:10 - Olly: Yes!
31/05/2022, 09:17 - Nathan: omg
31/05/2022, 09:18 - John Begley: Film?
31/05/2022, 09:20 - Nathan: La Jetée
31/05/2022, 09:21 - John Begley: Fran-cais-fi?
31/05/2022, 15:42 - Luke: Going to have to retract this thumbs up. Izzy has just tested positive for covid, so I can't come sci-fi 😞
31/05/2022, 15:43 - Nathan: Oh no, sorry. Hope it's perfectly asymptomatic for both of you.
31/05/2022, 16:15 - John Begley: That's rubbish. Hope it's not bad covid
31/05/2022, 16:27 - Luke: Cheers guys! Izzy is pretty ill, but no fever dreams or anything like that 🤞
I am absolutely fine and testing negative 🤷‍♂️
31/05/2022, 16:58 - Olly: Take care both of you!
31/05/2022, 17:26 - John Begley: In addition - Because of a shopping delivery I have to be home by 9
31/05/2022, 17:26 - John Begley: Equally happy to host
31/05/2022, 17:27 - John Begley: There might be a train from maze hill to st Alban's ...
31/05/2022, 18:49 - Nathan: Provisional okay from me
31/05/2022, 19:59 - Olly: I've just realised that I'm infact 60/40 for coming tomorrow because of a dependence on a work deadline. Will know by midday of I can make it. Johns or Nathan's is fine by me
01/06/2022, 14:09 - Olly: I can make sci fi tonight, but where is it??
01/06/2022, 15:05 - Nathan: John's
01/06/2022, 16:15 - Olly: What's your address again John?
01/06/2022, 16:35 - John Begley: Flat 13 Pipers House Collington Street se109lu
01/06/2022, 16:51 - Olly: Trains are such that I'll be there 630pm
01/06/2022, 16:51 - Olly: +10 mins
01/06/2022, 17:03 - John Begley: Woohoo
01/06/2022, 21:41 - Olly: I ran too fast
01/06/2022, 21:45 - John Begley: Haha, too early?
01/06/2022, 21:51 - Olly: I'm on a train full of noisy cunts. Proper Friday night happening here
01/06/2022, 21:52 - John Begley: It's your classic Wednesday-Friday
01/06/2022, 22:34 - John Begley: Oli, have you got the catnip cat vid you took?
01/06/2022, 22:40 - Olly: <Media omitted>
21/06/2022, 10:25 - Nathan: Any sci-fiers for tomorrow?
21/06/2022, 15:28 - Olly: Would love to but I'll be jet lagged, landing tomorrow...
21/06/2022, 15:36 - John Begley: I'm free!
21/06/2022, 16:23 - Luke: I'm free from 6.30
22/06/2022, 22:58 - Luke: <Media omitted>
05/07/2022, 09:42 - Nathan: I just won the lottery...for supernormal tickets. Did anyone else? Do any of you actually want to come?
05/07/2022, 09:55 - John Begley: Hahaha, what is the date?
05/07/2022, 10:08 - Luke: Lol. I was definitely interested back in April... can I think about it and get back to you tonight?

Also what tier are the tickets?

John, I think 12-14th August
05/07/2022, 10:15 - Nathan: All tiers available at the moment.
05/07/2022, 10:41 - Olly: I'm struggling right now to comprehend that I could ever drink again. This is because I went to a stag-do at the weekend, and the hangover on Sunday morphed into my first covid experience. So I feel bad that the alcohol had underservedly got the scapegoat (tautology?), but I'm sure it won't last long and I will be able to imagine myself having fun at a festival again in the near future
05/07/2022, 18:27 - Luke: Thinking done. If you still have some of your allocation remaining, I am up for it! Tier 1 please.
05/07/2022, 18:28 - Nathan: Yeah, cool. I bought 4 at tier 1, so 1 left.
05/07/2022, 19:20 - John Begley: I'm in. How much is it?
05/07/2022, 19:21 - Nathan: Minimum of £110.
05/07/2022, 19:31 - Luke: Ace, cheers!
13/07/2022, 06:57 - John Begley: <Media omitted>
13/07/2022, 07:04 - Luke: Lol! It really is. Didn't we realize our voting methods were a way of getting a result no one was particularly happy about....
14/07/2022, 20:25 - John Begley: <Media omitted>
14/07/2022, 20:50 - Olly: Exta low budget looking
14/07/2022, 20:56 - Luke: Nice. Unlike ferfect fried chicken they picked a substitute letter which doesn't obviously sound disgusting
14/07/2022, 21:27 - John Begley: 😆😆😆
14/07/2022, 21:27 - John Begley: But monley is not a convincing word
14/07/2022, 21:29 - Luke: Lol very true 😂
27/07/2022, 13:24 - Nathan: Sci-fi tonight?
27/07/2022, 13:27 - John Begley: Yep
27/07/2022, 13:48 - Olly: It's train strikes today I think, so not me
27/07/2022, 14:06 - Luke: Yeh!
08/08/2022, 19:22 - Nathan: Any sci-fiers this Wednesday?
09/08/2022, 08:47 - Luke: Oooo, not sure. Will let you know tonight
09/08/2022, 08:55 - Olly: Yep I think so
09/08/2022, 11:06 - Olly: Has repo man been shown at sci fi?
09/08/2022, 11:07 - John Begley: Yep, but I think it has been a long time since
09/08/2022, 11:23 - Olly: Good good
09/08/2022, 11:34 - James A: Great film! Repo Man is always intense…
09/08/2022, 16:41 - Luke: You proposing some sci-fi is watched tomorrow?
09/08/2022, 16:42 - Olly: Sounds a bit experimental to me
17/08/2022, 08:52 - Nathan: Sci-fi tonight?
17/08/2022, 10:16 - Olly: Can't tonight I'm afraid, at hair-fi
17/08/2022, 13:36 - John Begley: I'm in Weymouth
17/08/2022, 13:36 - John Begley: Wey-fi
17/08/2022, 14:02 - Luke: I'm just really really tired, ti-fi??
Sorry!

But up for some table tennis/games/even scifi at the weekend
17/08/2022, 14:56 - Nathan: Absolutely top quality reasons all round. You're all excused.
18/08/2022, 10:35 - John Begley: Someone in Weymouth stopped me to comment on how cool my bike was
18/08/2022, 10:36 - John Begley: It was an incredible moment
18/08/2022, 11:10 - Nathan: I'm so happy for you
18/08/2022, 11:10 - Nathan: It was all worth it
18/08/2022, 11:18 - John Begley: 😆
18/08/2022, 11:22 - Olly: Can you post a photo of your bike?
18/08/2022, 11:23 - Nathan: <Media omitted>
18/08/2022, 11:26 - Olly: 💃 sexy
18/08/2022, 11:46 - John Begley: I'll take one tonight
18/08/2022, 16:25 - Luke: 🎉 amazing!!
18/08/2022, 16:27 - Luke: I went for a swim last night and tried to have a look at this in the dark, but it wasn't very impressive. Looks pretty gross in daylight 👌
19/08/2022, 19:02 - Nathan: <Media omitted>
19/08/2022, 19:03 - John Begley: Hahahahaha
19/08/2022, 20:31 - Olly: Uber gross
19/08/2022, 23:15 - Luke: Trapped? Or spawned?? 🤔
31/08/2022, 14:05 - Nathan: Any sci-fiers tonight?
31/08/2022, 15:31 - John Begley: Sorry I'm in Cambridge today
31/08/2022, 16:08 - Olly: Sorry can't do today I'm afraid
31/08/2022, 17:14 - Nathan: John, are you gonna be working Wednesdays for a while? Should we think about moving sci-fi?
31/08/2022, 17:31 - John Begley: Yes
31/08/2022, 17:31 - John Begley: Tuesday!
31/08/2022, 17:47 - Nathan: How are Tuesdays for the other regulars?
31/08/2022, 18:16 - Luke: Sorry just saw this now. Fancy some table tennis?
31/08/2022, 18:18 - Nathan: Yesss
31/08/2022, 18:18 - Luke: Yeh! I was never happy about moving from Tuesday to Wednesday in the first place. So this is a return to norm I fully support
31/08/2022, 18:21 - Luke: Cool, me and Iz are walking over to the green now? Will be there in 19
31/08/2022, 18:21 - Luke: I mean 10
31/08/2022, 21:45 - Olly: Tues' are ok for me!
31/08/2022, 21:49 - Nathan: Tuesdays are the new Wednesdays.
31/08/2022, 21:56 - Olly: And the old Wednesday's apparently
31/08/2022, 21:58 - Nathan: Yeah, Luke reckons Wednesdays have been the new Tuesdays since 2017.
31/08/2022, 21:59 - John Begley: Someone's got their wires crossed. Pretty sure we started this group in mid-2022...
31/08/2022, 22:22 - Luke: Lol. We were worried about this causing origin story based splits 😬
31/08/2022, 23:48 - Nathan: I have unearthed some evidence that the first sci-fi night was on Monday 3rd March 2014.
01/09/2022, 06:27 - John Begley: 🤯 what evidence?
01/09/2022, 17:11 - Olly: If it has gone on since 2014 then all the sci fi must be watched...
01/09/2022, 17:11 - Olly: Unless this list says otherwise:
01/09/2022, 17:11 - Olly: https://www.imdb.com/list/ls073096054/?sort=list_order,asc&st_dt=&mode=detail&page=1
01/09/2022, 17:12 - Olly: They all seem to be exploitation films, so are bound to be very bad and very wrong. But technically sci fi still
01/09/2022, 17:13 - John Begley: Great front covers though
01/09/2022, 17:15 - John Begley: <Media omitted>
02/09/2022, 16:44 - Nathan: Incredibly, I think we've only seen 4 of the 150 films on that list. We've got a lot of work to do.
02/09/2022, 21:54 - Olly: There's going to be some 1.5x
06/09/2022, 10:29 - Nathan: Sci-fi tonight?
06/09/2022, 11:01 - John Begley: Yep
06/09/2022, 12:19 - Olly: Yes!
06/09/2022, 14:03 - Nathan: Olly, want to sort food out in advance like last time?
06/09/2022, 14:07 - Olly: If you're up for it, why not!? I can bring some beers
06/09/2022, 14:20 - Luke: Yeh! I will pop along for a bit but have a mandatory after work lecture 😞 so may not be along until 7. I also have food I need to eat, so eat without me!
06/09/2022, 15:07 - John Begley: I am sorry but I am no longer able to make it
08/09/2022, 18:42 - John Begley: It's about tradition and respect
08/09/2022, 19:25 - Nathan: and The Smiths
08/09/2022, 19:25 - Nathan: https://open.spotify.com/track/03ZwNF6FTvazNuOXNQf8k8?si=wt4FnhoeTru6vDfE8-Hzew&utm_source=whatsapp
08/09/2022, 19:26 - Nathan: Give it a play, have a little dance
08/09/2022, 23:15 - Olly: It was the first plan that came to my head too

04/10/2022, 13:22 - Nathan: Any sci-fiers tonight?
04/10/2022, 13:43 - John Begley: I'm too covidy
04/10/2022, 15:38 - Olly: It turns out that Tuesdays are a bit tricky for me, as that's a day I have to go into (new) work 😖
04/10/2022, 16:43 - Luke: Sorry! I thought it wasn't happening tonight so this morning I arranged DnD 🧙‍♂️
04/10/2022, 16:43 - Luke: I am flexible for another move 🤷‍♂️
04/10/2022, 16:47 - Nathan: How about Thursdays?

04/10/2022, 22:08 - Olly: Yes Thurs good!
04/10/2022, 23:12 - Luke: Cool, why not
05/10/2022, 12:36 - Nathan: Got a good feeling about this. I have always felt Thursday was the most sci-fi of days. I think sci-fi night has finally found its home.
05/10/2022, 12:45 - John Begley: You say that like it's not still early days
06/10/2022, 12:16 - Olly: I'll be there 630 I think

18/10/2022, 20:39 - Luke: Yeh!
20/10/2022, 08:35 - Olly: I'm in!
20/10/2022, 09:33 - Nathan: Cool. I'm working from home today so sci-fi night starts now.
20/10/2022, 09:45 - Olly: I'll be there about 630
20/10/2022, 14:23 - Luke: I'm free from 4ish?? As have Thursday afternoons off. So if you fancy starting early I'll pop over then
20/10/2022, 14:27 - Nathan: Yeah, come on over.
20/10/2022, 14:27 - Luke: See you at 4 then
20/10/2022, 18:24 - Olly: Did I just see a beauty salon called "real sorry beauty salon"? Mixed blessings bakery has a competitor
21/10/2022, 07:56 - John Begley: Hahahahaha
27/10/2022, 09:25 - Nathan: Sci-fi tonight?

10/11/2022, 13:42 - Luke: Would like to, but meant to go to something. Chance I may be able to pop down after. Will let you know.

30/11/2022, 21:09 - Nathan: Alright lads. Going to the pub for the footie tomorrow evening. All welcome. Can imagine it's robots vs aliens if it helps?
30/11/2022, 21:12 - John Begley: Hahaha, what pub?
30/11/2022, 21:34 - Nathan: A local pub. Showing the right match.
30/11/2022, 21:35 - Luke: Japan Spain?

15/12/2022, 08:31 - Nathan: Any sci-fiers tonight?

22/12/2022, 13:47 - Luke: Ooo this sounds ace 👌
29/12/2022, 15:48 - Nathan: How about a short-notice sci-fi tonight?
29/12/2022, 17:08 - Luke: Sorry, can't on the short notice. Me and Izzy are now at the finale of a really emotional K-drama, and just no way we can't watch it tonight, would be tortuous. But would be up for scifi/anything else in the next few days
29/12/2022, 17:59 - John Begley: I'm not free either I'm afraid
29/12/2022, 18:12 - Nathan: How about a sci-fi tomorrow?

01/02/2023, 09:07 - Nathan: Sci-fi tomorrow?

01/02/2023, 10:21 - Luke: Yeh!
01/02/2023, 14:12 - Olly: I've just been told at short notice I have to go into office on Thursday. But I thought of a crazy plan involving driving to Camberwell from Cambridge. But if there anywhere to park in the evening?
01/02/2023, 14:13 - Olly: *is
01/02/2023, 14:57 - Nathan: Think John uses an app called Just Park to find spaces.
01/02/2023, 14:59 - John Begley: True story
01/02/2023, 14:59 - Olly: Cheers I'll take a look
01/02/2023, 18:32 - Luke: Also I think after 6.30pm you can just park on the back streets around Camberwell

https://www.southwark.gov.uk/parking/find-somewhere-to-park/parking-zones
01/02/2023, 18:34 - Luke: And before 6.30pm I have a digital pass I can assign to you  for street parking near my flat (kind of behind the green area). Just let me know
02/02/2023, 09:20 - Olly: Cheers Luke! I will get there around 630 hopefully, so can try a back street 🤞
02/02/2023, 15:09 - Luke: What time?
02/02/2023, 15:10 - Nathan: Half 4?
02/02/2023, 16:26 - Olly: 645

16/02/2023, 10:25 - Luke: Enjoy! ⛷️😎
16/02/2023, 10:25 - Luke: Yeh!

09/03/2023, 09:01 - Olly: It's going to be extra fun this time, as there will be forms to sign
09/03/2023, 09:09 - Luke: With all the bureaucracy of sci-fi night voting, I can't believe it has taken this long to introduce actual paperwork
09/03/2023, 09:11 - Olly: There is a lot of processes to document. We need to have some meetings to make a plan of the process we need to document the processes
09/03/2023, 14:00 - John Begley: I'm in. What time?
09/03/2023, 14:24 - Luke: Yeh I'm up for it. Also what time?

11/03/2023, 22:30 - Spam: I’ll try and send a picture without being weird
11/03/2023, 22:31 - Spam: <Media omitted>
11/03/2023, 22:32 - Spam: This does little to help my case
11/03/2023, 22:32 - Spam: But you can see him
11/03/2023, 22:33 - Spam: <Media omitted>
11/03/2023, 22:33 - John Begley: Pretend you are taking a selfie right in front of him but flip the camera
11/03/2023, 22:33 - John Begley: This looks nothing like Luke
11/03/2023, 22:33 - Spam: Yep
11/03/2023, 22:33 - Spam: That’s what I was about to text
11/03/2023, 22:34 - Spam: The photo is poor, he’s a lot sexier in reality
11/03/2023, 22:34 - John Begley: Looks more like Mick Hucknell
11/03/2023, 22:37 - Spam: <Media omitted>
11/03/2023, 22:53 - Luke: Haha 😂 he does have great hair 👌but Izzy is outraged!
11/03/2023, 22:55 - Luke: Awww man, mick hucknall brings shame to gingers....along with Chris Evans...maybe famous gingers are just bad
11/03/2023, 23:02 - Luke: Omg only just read the article. Absolutely bizarre story and writing 🤯
15/03/2023, 10:58 - Nathan: People used to say I looked like Mick Hucknall back in 2004
15/03/2023, 10:58 - Nathan: <Media omitted>
15/03/2023, 10:58 - Nathan: What do you think?
15/03/2023, 10:59 - Nathan: Anyway, no sci-fi tomorrow but I'm around this evening?
15/03/2023, 11:17 - Olly: Those trousers should come back in fashion
15/03/2023, 11:18 - Olly: It might be the great sofa-bed build tonight, so don't think I'll make it
15/03/2023, 12:41 - Luke: Kind of similar to Oli, I'm doing some painting prep tonight
22/03/2023, 13:32 - Nathan: Sci-fi tomorrow?

23/03/2023, 15:03 - John Begley: Hahaha
23/03/2023, 15:03 - Olly: So keep your trap shut John!

02/05/2023, 12:19 - Olly: Really bad roadworks?
02/05/2023, 12:21 - John Begley: They have ruined the picturesque entrance to the park. There was a really nicely located public toilet right in the entrance before.
02/05/2023, 12:21 - Nathan: What are you going to piss next to now?
02/05/2023, 12:22 - John Begley: Maybe they have plans for a new dog mess bin 🤞
02/05/2023, 12:27 - Nathan: Maybe they're just moving the toilet to another entrance?
02/05/2023, 12:28 - John Begley: True, or replacing it with a bigger one that will block the entrance entirely
02/05/2023, 12:43 - Olly: Or building a much needed estate agents?
07/05/2023, 19:15 - Olly: In the interlude of Jeff Wayne  war of the world's immersive experience, it's frickin awesome

18/05/2023, 08:13 - John Begley: Sci fi?
18/05/2023, 08:23 - Nathan: I think so.

17/01/2024, 19:53 - Luke: The Kitchen has been released on netflix....can we save for sci-fi night? For when we get through the big blue head
17/01/2024, 21:40 - Nathan: Great, yeah. Speaking of the big blue head...tomorrow night, anyone?
17/01/2024, 22:52 - Luke: Yeh, I'm up for it
18/01/2024, 06:35 - John Begley: I reckon
18/01/2024, 07:09 - Olly: Next time, have fun!
18/01/2024, 12:25 - Nathan: From 4 pm
18/01/2024, 16:31 - Nathan: ETAs?
18/01/2024, 16:31 - Luke: 10 mins
18/01/2024, 16:35 - John Begley: About 45
18/01/2024, 18:16 - John Begley: This message was deleted
18/01/2024, 18:17 - Nathan: Pollo 32
KFC 43
Shawarma 25
24/01/2024, 21:19 - Nathan: Sci-fi tomorrow?
24/01/2024, 21:38 - John Begley: Yep
24/01/2024, 21:55 - Olly: I'm on ski-tru I'm afraid
24/01/2024, 22:08 - Luke: Yeh, can't miss the big blue head
25/01/2024, 14:07 - Nathan: I'm home all day. ETAs?
25/01/2024, 14:07 - John Begley: Half five probably
25/01/2024, 14:49 - Luke: ...not sure...definitely by half 5
25/01/2024, 16:41 - Luke: About 5
31/01/2024, 20:23 - Luke: Big blue head finale tomorrow?
31/01/2024, 20:35 - Nathan: Looking pretty unlikely, been quite ill today. Will let you know if I make a miraculous recovery tomorrow.
31/01/2024, 20:38 - Luke: Awww no! No worries. Hope you get better soon! And let us know if you need anything
01/02/2024, 07:03 - John Begley: Hope you feel better
01/02/2024, 09:39 - Olly: Get well soon!
05/02/2024, 12:12 - Nathan: Anyone interested in Dune part 1 at BFI IMAX on Thurs 29th Feb 20:30 for a sci-fi night outing?
05/02/2024, 12:26 - Luke: Yeh!
05/02/2024, 12:27 - Luke: Part 2 the week after?
05/02/2024, 13:49 - Nathan: Yeah, something like that
05/02/2024, 14:08 - Olly: I think so, but will let you know. You feeling better now Nathan?
05/02/2024, 14:58 - Nathan: Ok, going to buy tickets on Thursday morning when they go on sale.

I'm sort of better, thanks, but also have tonsillitis which is really quite unpleasant.
05/02/2024, 14:58 - John Begley: I'm in
07/02/2024, 17:27 - Olly: Sorry can't make 29th Feb turns out
07/02/2024, 18:30 - Nathan: That's a shame. John and Luke, one ticket each or can you lure your partners out with a bit of Chalomet?
07/02/2024, 18:34 - Luke: Just had to look up what Chalomet meant 🤦‍♂️Thought it didn't sound like a Dune word
07/02/2024, 18:36 - Luke: Izzy politely declines
07/02/2024, 18:40 - John Begley: So is it me you and Luke, plus one extra?
07/02/2024, 22:26 - Nathan: + Fumi
07/02/2024, 22:29 - Nathan: How about a bit of sci-fi (big blue head) tomorrow?
08/02/2024, 06:35 - John Begley: I'm in
08/02/2024, 08:33 - Luke: Yep 🫡
08/02/2024, 15:17 - Olly: Yes sir
08/02/2024, 16:34 - Nathan: From half five, see you soon!
08/02/2024, 17:57 - Nathan: Buzzer is broken. Gimme a call to get in.
08/02/2024, 19:51 - Olly: <Media omitted>
08/02/2024, 20:34 - Luke: https://youtu.be/ySotSZsi4dk?si=6G6dfoFkxXu1MtBw
12/02/2024, 09:32 - Nathan: Tickets for Dune 2 at BFI IMAX on sale today. Selling fast. Thursday 7th March?
12/02/2024, 09:33 - Luke: Looks good to me
12/02/2024, 09:45 - John Begley: I'm in
12/02/2024, 14:03 - Olly: I'm in
12/02/2024, 14:05 - Olly: 830pm right?
12/02/2024, 14:12 - Nathan: Yeah, unfortunately there aren't many seats left now. Either right at the front or the side. Not sure I wanna spend £24 on a shit seat.
12/02/2024, 14:14 - Olly: Damn, shame I didn't look at my phone all morning
12/02/2024, 14:14 - John Begley: Right at the front though, as discussed are in fact the best seats. You really get the  maximum benefit from the 25m screen size. Those twats sitting in row three could just go to the Greenwich IMAX. <This message was edited>
12/02/2024, 14:15 - Olly: How many people can fit right in front of your TV?
12/02/2024, 14:47 - Nathan: Ok, we've got 2nd row.
12/02/2024, 14:49 - Luke: What row are we for Dune 1?
12/02/2024, 14:49 - Dodo: row F
12/02/2024, 14:57 - Olly: I will bring a (short-)triangular-faced-prism-shaped cushion, so that my body angle will be extra reclined, mitigating any neck issues following the experience. Can't wait, post-birthday-tru-sci-fi
12/02/2024, 15:06 - Luke: Pretty good comparison for 2nd row 🤓
18/02/2024, 17:19 - Luke: In case we ever have to do a tie breaker on the food vote again 🤔

https://twitter.com/Dexerto/status/1758856575588909118?t=b0QY3jS9zv0UZi7eTTmkOQ&s=19
18/02/2024, 17:21 - John Begley: We really need to be doing this much more often than when the tie break happens.
18/02/2024, 17:21 - John Begley: It might have enough momentum for it's own night...
18/02/2024, 18:09 - Luke: I'm going to start training for this when I'm cooking dinner. Izzy may have to get used to a (much) later dinner time
18/02/2024, 18:33 - John Begley: And one that is entirely pretzel-based
18/02/2024, 18:40 - John Begley: <Media omitted>
21/02/2024, 14:15 - Nathan: Big blue head tomorrow?
21/02/2024, 15:28 - John Begley: I'm in
21/02/2024, 15:32 - Luke: Yeh!
21/02/2024, 17:10 - Olly: Yes! Do I need to do the homework, or does it make no sense anyway?
21/02/2024, 18:02 - John Begley: Here is everything you need to know about it so far in the form of a haiku:

A head from the past,
Scientists unlock it's thoughts,
It's opened it's eyes
21/02/2024, 18:32 - Luke: There are some rebels
They really hate fine dining
The groups name is Ron
21/02/2024, 18:34 - John Begley: It's funny cos it's true
22/02/2024, 13:40 - Luke: What time?
22/02/2024, 13:41 - Nathan: Not sure yet. Prob not till 5 though. Will let you know later.
22/02/2024, 16:32 - Nathan: Yeah, about 5
22/02/2024, 16:56 - Nathan: And I think the buzzer is still broken
22/02/2024, 17:12 - Luke: Am downstairs
22/02/2024, 17:25 - John Begley: I am downstairs
22/02/2024, 17:25 - Nathan: Should be open
22/02/2024, 17:25 - John Begley: Shall I shut it
22/02/2024, 17:25 - Nathan: No
22/02/2024, 17:39 - Nathan: Olly, do you mind if we start the Big Blue Head without you?
22/02/2024, 17:52 - Olly: Go for it. I will be there  639
23/02/2024, 13:10 - Olly: By my calculations (which are often wrong), the sweet-spot (or suit-spot?) is sqrt(I/m) distance from the pivot, where I is the moment of inertia of the bat.
23/02/2024, 13:11 - Olly: and m is the mass of the ball
23/02/2024, 13:20 - Olly: For a cylindrical cross section bat, I=(1/3)*mb*L^2, where mb is batt mass and L is bat length. So for very light balls the end is always the spot, but for heavy balls it is closer to the pivot
23/02/2024, 13:21 - Olly: I should have sent this in the evening, as a sleep aid for anyone reading
23/02/2024, 13:22 - Nathan: This is for a bat swinging freely from a fixed pivot with an elastic collision?
23/02/2024, 13:25 - Olly: Yep. Angular momentum is conserved if there is no external torque, which I guess is an ok approximation if you get a good swing arc
23/02/2024, 13:26 - Nathan: I still think the force from the pivot provides an external torque on the bat
23/02/2024, 13:30 - Olly: I've taken the pivot as the origin so any linear force applied at the pivot creates no torque. And so such a force doesn't appear in energy or angular momentum calcs. I'm just assuming that the hand is providing no torque (only angular inertia acting) at the moment of collision.
03/03/2024, 08:17 - Nathan: I think today is the 10-year anniversary of sci-fi night. Thanks for coming!
03/03/2024, 08:18 - Luke: 🎉🎉🎉
03/03/2024, 09:09 - Olly: 🥳
03/03/2024, 09:10 - John Begley: <Media omitted>
07/03/2024, 11:41 - Olly: What's the plan Stan? Eating dinner before film?
07/03/2024, 12:02 - Nathan: Yes, good idea. Voting open.
07/03/2024, 14:16 - Nathan: https://maps.app.goo.gl/aP46s52jm6DYmeEm7

Note: last time I went the side options were "baked beans or peas"
07/03/2024, 14:20 - John Begley: McDonald's

07/03/2024, 16:26 - Olly: I vote kfc
07/03/2024, 16:28 - Luke: I am happy with anything but McDonald's (sorry John!). Cus 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
07/03/2024, 16:28 - Luke: What time we thinking?
07/03/2024, 16:29 - Nathan: Half 6?
07/03/2024, 16:34 - Nathan: I vote KFC as a birthday present
07/03/2024, 16:36 - Spam: I'll vote KFC
07/03/2024, 16:37 - John Begley: I'm awaiting my turn, but I am also voting KFC
07/03/2024, 17:26 - Olly: I'll get into waterloo at 615
07/03/2024, 17:27 - Olly: Where to meet?
07/03/2024, 17:33 - Nathan: KFC?
07/03/2024, 17:39 - Olly: In the station?
07/03/2024, 17:42 - Nathan: Whichever one you chose...
07/03/2024, 17:43 - Nathan: Or we could have a beer first
07/03/2024, 17:46 - John Begley: I'm pretty hungry...
07/03/2024, 17:46 - Olly: KFC, then beer, then KFC, then film
07/03/2024, 17:47 - Nathan: Haha
07/03/2024, 17:47 - Nathan: Early beer is good I think, given length of film and bladder size etc
07/03/2024, 17:47 - John Begley: It's a long film, might need a snack after...KFC
07/03/2024, 17:48 - Olly: I don't know the area, you choose the KFC, or tell me where to go for beer
07/03/2024, 17:49 - Nathan: Let's meet in the victory pub in the station
07/03/2024, 17:49 - Nathan: I'll be there about 1815 too
07/03/2024, 17:50 - Nathan: The station KFC looks lovely. Not quite flagship level but close
07/03/2024, 18:13 - Nathan: Victory very busy, trying other pubs.
07/03/2024, 18:19 - John Begley: I'm outside Victory. Where pub have you selected?
07/03/2024, 18:20 - Nathan: We're on the move. Is there a table?
07/03/2024, 18:22 - John Begley: I doubt it
07/03/2024, 18:22 - Nathan: Ok. We got a table in the Wellington
07/03/2024, 18:23 - John Begley: Give me a location pin
07/03/2024, 18:24 - Olly: location: https://maps.google.com/?q=51.5035779,-0.1111426
08/03/2024, 10:59 - Olly: <Media omitted>
08/03/2024, 11:00 - Olly: I was hoping for more. The less than reliable Nathan Sparks will have to fill in the details instead
08/03/2024, 11:51 - John Begley: Haha
08/03/2024, 12:33 - Olly: I just felt so sad it didn't give me a nice story which could then be enshrined in doctrine. AI is clearly not as useful as I'd hoped. No more will I trust it for any useful tasks
08/03/2024, 13:05 - Nathan: In 2014, a group of passionate science fiction fans and writers came together in a small community center in a bustling city to celebrate the "Democratization of Sci-Fi Night." The event was born out of a desire to break down barriers within the genre and provide a platform for marginalized voices, aspiring authors, and fans alike.

The evening kicked off with a panel discussion featuring diverse voices from the world of science fiction, including authors from underrepresented backgrounds, indie creators, and advocates for inclusivity in literature. They discussed the importance of representation in storytelling, the challenges faced by marginalized communities in the industry, and the ways in which science fiction can be a tool for social change.

Following the panel, attendees were invited to participate in interactive workshops led by local writers and artists. These workshops focused on various aspects of sci-fi creation, from world-building and character development to exploring themes of identity and social justice in speculative fiction.

As the night progressed, the community center buzzed with energy as attendees mingled, exchanged ideas, and shared their love for science fiction. A makeshift "open mic" session provided a platform for aspiring writers to showcase their work, regardless of their level of experience or background.

The event concluded with a screening of short films and fan-made content, highlighting the creativity and innovation of sci-fi enthusiasts from all walks of life. Amidst the laughter, applause, and spirited discussions, the "2014 Democratization of Sci-Fi Night" left a lasting impact on its attendees, inspiring them to continue pushing boundaries and championing diversity within the genre.
08/03/2024, 13:27 - Olly: Ah, but that was the "democratisation of sci-fi, night 2014", an event easily confused but very different from "democratisation of sci-fi-night 2014"
08/03/2024, 13:30 - Olly: *Sorry I meant "democratisation of sci-fi, night, 2014", an event easily confused but very different from "democratisation of sci-fi-night, 2014". "Democratisation of sci-fi, night 2014" was a of course a wholly different event again
08/03/2024, 13:57 - Luke: 👌And you guys were saying AI prompt engineers were redundant
16/03/2024, 18:24 - Olly: The adventures of buckaroo banzai across the eighth dimension. Seen it?
20/03/2024, 18:18 - John Begley: No
20/03/2024, 18:18 - John Begley: Good?
20/03/2024, 18:18 - John Begley: And is sci-fi on tomorrow?
20/03/2024, 18:23 - Nathan: ski-fi tomorrow
20/03/2024, 18:27 - John Begley: You're skiing? <This message was edited>
20/03/2024, 18:28 - Nathan: Yeah, everyone's welcome.
20/03/2024, 18:28 - John Begley: At your house?
20/03/2024, 18:28 - Nathan: Nah, Kuusamo
20/03/2024, 18:29 - John Begley: Oh cool. I'll be there. 17:35
03/04/2024, 13:14 - Nathan: Sci-fi tomorrow?
03/04/2024, 13:25 - John Begley: Yes please
03/04/2024, 13:26 - Luke: Yeh!
03/04/2024, 18:23 - Olly: Yes!
03/04/2024, 19:11 - Nathan: omg
04/04/2024, 17:07 - Luke: What time?
04/04/2024, 17:08 - Nathan: Any time from now
04/04/2024, 18:18 - Olly: Will be there 653
04/04/2024, 18:19 - Luke: Be there in 10
04/04/2024, 21:29 - Olly: I checked the internet. Fumi's got it right. Soap users have it wrong, according to the doctors. You've got to consider the natural oils!
04/04/2024, 22:14 - John Begley: I'm 37, and my ring has never been better. It really is going from strength to strength. I credit Pears soap, applied liberally.
04/04/2024, 23:04 - Olly: omg
17/04/2024, 12:16 - Nathan: shi-fi tomorrow?
17/04/2024, 13:32 - Luke: Yeh
17/04/2024, 20:57 - John Begley: Yes please.
17/04/2024, 21:25 - Olly: No can do I'm afraid, have fun
18/04/2024, 16:02 - John Begley: What time is shi-fi? <This message was edited>
18/04/2024, 16:07 - Nathan: Right here, right now
18/04/2024, 16:08 - John Begley: Shiiit. I'll start wrapping up work
18/04/2024, 16:59 - Luke: At a conference. But thinking will be there by 6
25/04/2024, 06:56 - Nathan: Sci-fi?
25/04/2024, 08:23 - Luke: Yes.
25/04/2024, 08:24 - John Begley: Not today I'm afraid
25/04/2024, 14:33 - Olly: Yep I'll be coming at some point
25/04/2024, 16:06 - Luke: What time?
25/04/2024, 16:06 - Nathan: Anytime
25/04/2024, 16:24 - Luke: Cool. Maybe 4.45-5 ish
25/04/2024, 17:08 - Olly: Sorry not going to make it afterall
30/04/2024, 11:52 - Nathan: Sci-fi on Thursday? Last one for a few weeks.
30/04/2024, 11:56 - Olly: Yes I think so
30/04/2024, 11:58 - John Begley: I reckon
30/04/2024, 14:57 - Luke: Why not
02/05/2024, 13:08 - Olly: Does anyone feel particularly susceptible to illness? I have a slight headache and had a sore throat for a couple of hours this morning. It could just be hayfever. Would be nice to visit, but don't want to make anyone scared they will get sick - so I'm happy to skip this one if preferred
02/05/2024, 13:08 - Olly: Headache not bad enough to be bothered to take paracetamol
02/05/2024, 13:55 - Nathan: Thanks for checking. I'm about to go on holiday so would really rather not get ill. Can you borrow a hazmat suit?
02/05/2024, 14:18 - Olly: No worries, have a good one will catch up next time!
02/05/2024, 17:43 - Luke: On my way. 10 mins
02/05/2024, 17:47 - Nathan: See you soon!

23/05/2024, 16:10 - Nathan: Cool. See you then
23/05/2024, 17:04 - Luke: Sorry, way too hopeful. Unexpected HASL delays. On my way now
29/05/2024, 18:48 - Nathan: Sorry, no sci-fi this week.
06/06/2024, 19:03 - Nathan: Sci-fi night homework: First episode(s) of Foundation.

13/06/2024, 18:50 - Olly: Pizza
13/06/2024, 18:51 - John Begley: Nathan: nandeen
13/06/2024, 18:51 - John Begley: Luke: Bolu
13/06/2024, 18:51 - John Begley: Bolu wins
13/06/2024, 18:51 - John Begley: What would you like?
13/06/2024, 18:52 - Olly: I'll have a chicken kofta in wrap with salad, garlic and chilli
13/06/2024, 18:52 - Olly: Will be at house at 18:59
13/06/2024, 21:32 - Luke: This was the HASL guardian article I was mentioning earlier

https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/jun/10/councils-move-hundreds-homeless-families-london-24-hour-ultimatums
14/06/2024, 05:54 - John Begley: Nice work. I was confused for a while, thinking who is Elizabeth Wyatt? Luke has literally never mentioned this person...oh, Izzy  🤦‍♂️
14/06/2024, 07:28 - John Begley: https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x31vnk5
14/06/2024, 07:34 - Luke: It has caused quite a lot of confusion. It has been the long term HASL spokesperson name we started using years ago. Our mate whose surname we stole for it is quite chill about it, and seems to like reading from his fictional sibling 😁
14/06/2024, 07:35 - John Begley: Is her actual name Elizabeth or Isabel?
14/06/2024, 07:38 - Luke: Lol, technically neither. But she uses her middle name, Isabelle, which is where Izzy comes from
14/06/2024, 07:40 - John Begley: Huh, wrapped in mystique
14/06/2024, 07:40 - John Begley: Guess we'll never know her real name
14/06/2024, 07:40 - Luke: 🤐
15/06/2024, 18:50 - Olly: You pretty much knew it word for word John!
15/06/2024, 18:51 - Olly: Nice work! Did the journalist do anything, or just write around the data and words you guys put hard work into?
15/06/2024, 18:52 - Luke: Haha, yeh totally agree, sending the clip round was almost unnecessary. Kind of think Limmy didn't do it as well John!
15/06/2024, 18:55 - Luke: I really like the journalist, so don't want to diminish their role too much, but basically. I thought they had spoken to people affected and got quotes, but then Izzy told me that one of the main quotes she had got from a sister group and provided to the journalist 😁 <This message was edited>
15/06/2024, 19:49 - John Begley: If only I paid attention to useful things!
19/06/2024, 22:02 - Nathan: Sci-fi?
19/06/2024, 22:53 - Luke: Foot-fi?
19/06/2024, 22:58 - Nathan: Yeah, I think so. It's a bit early, but I'll be here.
20/06/2024, 06:15 - John Begley: I'm in. What's foot-fi?
20/06/2024, 06:25 - Nathan: Foo-fi-fo-fum
20/06/2024, 06:26 - John Begley: Ah, ok. That's all clear now
20/06/2024, 08:34 - Olly: Can't tonight, packing my bags. Anyway, it sounds suspiciously like football might be involved somehow!
20/06/2024, 08:41 - John Begley: Ah, I really do understand now. Such is my lack of engaging in the euros so far that I didn't even consider it 🤣 <This message was edited>
20/06/2024, 08:42 - Olly: I was proud to say I didn't even know England, or anyone, were playing football the other day 🙂
20/06/2024, 09:35 - John Begley: So it's an 'indifference off' you're after, eh?
20/06/2024, 14:23 - Olly: I'm way too cool for that
20/06/2024, 14:23 - Olly: Indifferent about who's the most indifferent
20/06/2024, 14:24 - John Begley: I'd forgotten what we were talking about
20/06/2024, 14:25 - Olly: 🤣
20/06/2024, 16:04 - Luke: Aiming to be over yours at 5/just past 5 if your still up for watching some of the game
20/06/2024, 16:20 - Nathan: Oh yeah! See you soon
27/06/2024, 09:26 - Nathan: Sci-fi?
27/06/2024, 11:18 - Luke: Maybe. On a day trip to Brighton, and not sure when I will get back. Will let you know if I'm coming back in time for sci-fi
27/06/2024, 11:41 - John Begley: I may also be absent today. Not working from home
27/06/2024, 16:14 - Luke: Sorry, still in Brighton. Not going to make it this week
27/06/2024, 17:27 - Olly: In Corsica still
27/06/2024, 18:47 - John Begley: Sorry I also can't make it
08/07/2024, 16:34 - Olly: What's the confidence interval (at conductive level=95%) of there being a scifi on Thurs?
08/07/2024, 17:25 - Nathan: [No, Yes]
08/07/2024, 18:19 - Olly: As I thought
08/07/2024, 18:54 - Luke: How about in bayesian?
08/07/2024, 18:56 - Luke: Mainly as an exercise in helping me to understand what bayesian means 😁
08/07/2024, 19:23 - Nathan: That is actually the C.I. of the Bayesian posterior. The prior C.I. was also [No, Yes] though.
08/07/2024, 19:56 - Nathan: But the 90% C.I. is [Yes, Yes] so it's looking pretty good.
11/07/2024, 05:56 - Nathan: Sci-fi?
11/07/2024, 07:14 - Luke: Yeh!
11/07/2024, 07:21 - Olly: Nope ☹️
11/07/2024, 07:23 - John Begley: I reckon
11/07/2024, 16:38 - Nathan: Watch out for flying ants
11/07/2024, 16:44 - Luke: What time?
11/07/2024, 16:46 - Nathan: 5
11/07/2024, 16:56 - Nathan: If you're going home first, could you bring the pink knife?
18/07/2024, 15:13 - Luke: Any scifi tonight?
18/07/2024, 15:17 - Nathan: Sorry, not tonight. But fans of upholstery will be pleased to note that the plastic covers have been removed for next time.
18/07/2024, 15:19 - John Begley: Shame. It had a very scifi feel
18/07/2024, 15:37 - Luke: So dust free
21/08/2024, 20:34 - Nathan: Sci-fi tomorrow?
21/08/2024, 21:03 - Olly: I can basically never do Thurs ever again unfortunately. I vote for Mon, Tues or wed next week  if people are up for changing the day...
21/08/2024, 21:41 - Nathan: Tuesday or Wednesday next week is alright with me.
21/08/2024, 22:27 - Luke: Yeh Tues/wed good for me next week too
22/08/2024, 05:03 - John Begley: Wednesday is a bit crap for me. Monday would be better. But I can try Wednesday for a bit
22/08/2024, 05:03 - John Begley: I am free today too
22/08/2024, 08:32 - Luke: Today I may be able to pop along for a bit. Sorry can't commit more, just an odd day for me
22/08/2024, 17:24 - Luke: So can't do tonight as got some stuff I need to prep for tomorrow 😞 but me and Izzy are going FM mangak now if anyone fancies joining?
22/08/2024, 17:26 - Nathan: Actually, John and I just decided to meet at the midpoint instead. 

What are you going to have?
22/08/2024, 17:31 - Luke: No idea. Any suggestions?
22/08/2024, 17:31 - Luke: Where do you go at the midpoint?
22/08/2024, 17:38 - Nathan: Marquis of Granby
22/08/2024, 18:04 - Luke: Is it good? or is it just non-negotiable as the midpoint?
22/08/2024, 19:27 - John Begley: It's non-negotiable. The area is bad
27/08/2024, 09:49 - Nathan: So, sci-fi tonight?
27/08/2024, 09:50 - John Begley: No for me I'm afraid
27/08/2024, 11:23 - Luke: Me neither. How about tomorrow?
27/08/2024, 11:36 - Olly: I prefer tomorrow, but could probably make this evening
27/08/2024, 11:38 - Nathan: Ok, let's do tomorrow this week. 

Thinking about switching to Mondays after that. Is that ok with everyone?
27/08/2024, 11:45 - Olly: Yep, good for me!
28/08/2024, 15:16 - Nathan: ETAs?
28/08/2024, 15:46 - Luke: 6.15pm (sorry, got urgent freezer admin) <This message was edited>
28/08/2024, 16:09 - Olly: 6:14:59
28/08/2024, 16:09 - Olly: Pm
28/08/2024, 18:16 - Nathan: You're both late
28/08/2024, 18:17 - Luke: Going through the swimming pool carpark
02/09/2024, 07:04 - John Begley: Is today the all-new sci-fi night that guarantees complete attendance? Looking forward to seeing James and Sam.
02/09/2024, 07:05 - Nathan: Oh yeah, it is. I forgot. But it's on!
02/09/2024, 08:11 - Olly: I'm in Crete this week! Have a good one
02/09/2024, 08:21 - Luke: Yeh, I'm up for it. For the novelty of Monday night sci-fi
02/09/2024, 13:07 - Luke: Sooo, me and Izzy have ended up with loads of injera and the good spicy chicken curry to go with it. Do people fancy that tonight? 

Sorry for starting the food vote early. I just need to know asap as will need to remove some injera from the freezer
02/09/2024, 13:07 - Luke: Izzy just sent me photos of the quantities of curry, and you would be helping us out! So much
02/09/2024, 13:14 - Nathan: I vote yes
02/09/2024, 13:18 - John Begley: The original Terminator is playing in 4k at Greenwich Picturehouse tonight, 8pm. Reckon I'll go. Fancy?
02/09/2024, 13:19 - John Begley: Forwarded from my neighbor. I'll just come to Camberwell if there's no takers but I thought I would forward before I refused seeing as it is so scifi
02/09/2024, 13:22 - John Begley: Also yes, if no to the above film option. Which I assume is a no
02/09/2024, 13:47 - Luke: Ooo would normally be interested. But I am leaning to staying in camberwell, to help me with the Eritrean food, and because I was in Greenwich yesterday....but mainly the food <This message was edited>
02/09/2024, 13:59 - Luke: @447846218468 what are you thinking? Camberwell or Greenwich?
02/09/2024, 14:20 - Nathan: I feel like chicken tonight!
02/09/2024, 14:27 - Luke: Ace.me and Izzy will be around at about 5.30 with food
02/09/2024, 14:28 - John Begley: Where? Nathan's?
02/09/2024, 14:35 - Luke: Yes! If that is ok with Nathan?
02/09/2024, 14:36 - Luke: The eritreans who are the source of this food, told me in *very* broken English that a microwave is key for defrosting the injera (or that's what I think was said)

And I don't have a microwave
02/09/2024, 14:41 - John Begley: What's the spice level of the food?
02/09/2024, 14:51 - Luke: Ermmmm not eaten this batch yet. But the version I had at the HASL picnic on Saturday (from the same cook) was not that hot; but it is 'spicy' as in there are are lots of spices. I will also make a quick spinach side, that I can not put any chilli in
02/09/2024, 14:53 - John Begley: Cool. I'm generally fine these days with medium to hot food. But if it's pure ring sting all the way, I'll get a burger <This message was edited>
02/09/2024, 14:54 - Luke: Fair enough. I didn't know this was a ring sting focused question. I can give my guarantee, I have never had the slightest ring sting from this dish before 💯
02/09/2024, 14:55 - John Begley: Cool. Sounds fine then. And where is it on the gut rot scale?
02/09/2024, 14:55 - John Begley: Morelys being about a 6 for me with 100 percent success rate
02/09/2024, 14:55 - Luke: 0⃣
02/09/2024, 15:09 - Nathan: Sounds great! Yep, I'll be home by half five.
07/09/2024, 16:09 - John Begley: <Media omitted>
08/09/2024, 20:30 - Nathan: Sci-fi tomorrow?
08/09/2024, 20:30 - John Begley: Unfortunately not. I have to take Logan to the vet and tomorrow was the only spot they had this week
08/09/2024, 20:37 - Luke: Yeh, I'm up for it. As I'm not about for the next 2 sci-fis
08/09/2024, 20:39 - Luke: Hope Logan is ok!
08/09/2024, 20:44 - Olly: All the best to Logan! Just back from Greece, sorry think I might have to skip the one tomorrow
21/09/2024, 19:20 - Nathan: <Media omitted>
21/09/2024, 19:39 - Olly: I never noticed cong!
21/09/2024, 19:40 - Olly: I'm relieved gizzard is a major one, was worried about that
21/09/2024, 19:51 - Nathan: <Media omitted>
22/09/2024, 23:31 - Nathan: Sci-fi tomorrow?
23/09/2024, 07:07 - John Begley: I have to meet a colleague today after work as part of a bit of informal non-work/work networking
23/09/2024, 07:08 - Luke: Sorry, in Madrid
23/09/2024, 08:39 - Olly: Can't either today, recovering from weekend
29/09/2024, 21:21 - Nathan: Sci-fi tomorrow?
29/09/2024, 22:06 - Luke: Yeh! <This message was edited>
29/09/2024, 22:14 - Olly: I think so!
30/09/2024, 06:19 - John Begley: I'm in.
30/09/2024, 06:20 - John Begley: I have been very vaguely ill. Victoria has been more ill. Just a cold though, and mine is mostly gone.
30/09/2024, 17:07 - Luke: What time?
30/09/2024, 17:08 - Nathan: Anytime
30/09/2024, 17:14 - Olly: Trains suddenly so messed up, so staying home ☹️
30/09/2024, 17:14 - Olly: *all not do
30/09/2024, 17:14 - Olly: *all not so or do
01/10/2024, 21:07 - John Begley: https://universaldork.com/2010/07/21/inception-vs-dreamscape/
01/10/2024, 21:43 - Nathan: Yeah, sorry Olly, you missed some excellent stop-animation snakeman action last night.
01/10/2024, 21:46 - Luke: Damn those trains. Best sci-fi night film in the last couple of years....out of all 8 we've managed to watch 😁
01/10/2024, 22:04 - Olly: Damn those pesky trains! I can't believe it
01/10/2024, 22:05 - Olly: Dreamscape?
05/10/2024, 10:24 - Olly: <Media omitted>
06/10/2024, 12:11 - Olly: Is a theatre production of Dr strangelove starring Steve coogan scifi?
06/10/2024, 12:30 - John Begley: This is very good stuff
06/10/2024, 15:49 - Nathan: Let's discuss at sci-fi night tomorrow.
06/10/2024, 16:01 - Luke: 👍I'm up for sci-fi tomorrow <This message was edited>
06/10/2024, 16:27 - Olly: Yep I'll be there
07/10/2024, 14:47 - Olly: ETA 6:32
07/10/2024, 15:34 - Luke: 5.30
07/10/2024, 15:37 - Nathan: Great. I'll try to get back for half 5. Will let you know if I'm running late.
07/10/2024, 23:54 - Nathan: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10_SXn4-rjj-IsHp3m7qnsLjLW_vA8QTxjZzTrGkkELk/edit?usp=sharing
07/10/2024, 23:55 - Nathan: I've put in your "watched" columns. Only 79 films watched by 2 or more people...
Feel free to update, but let me know if a film has wrong data - year, run time etc
08/10/2024, 06:31 - John Begley: Did you watch Back to the future at sci-fi night? On your own?
08/10/2024, 07:21 - Luke: I feel like I have a vague memory of watching the first one at scifi (because I had never seen it before)
08/10/2024, 07:24 - John Begley: Mad. So main stream.
08/10/2024, 07:28 - Luke: Can we please have a column that is 'number of films seen by 1 or more'? so we know how many in total were allegedly watched at scifi night. Just because Nathan is really carrying the weight in that spreadsheet. Also it would be good to see the difference between the at least 1 and more than 1 totals
08/10/2024, 08:46 - Olly: I don't know how many Nathan remembers, but really it should be a "seen by John and Nathan column" as my and Luke's recollection is worthless
08/10/2024, 09:21 - Nathan: I've added the >0 column.179 vs 95.
08/10/2024, 09:58 - John Begley: As the ultimate mind-jogger, a link to the trailer would be useful. Massive task though
08/10/2024, 10:06 - Nathan: I can do a link to the IMDb pretty easily. That has a trailer for most films
08/10/2024, 10:09 - Luke: That's such a ridiculous difference, especially as 99% of sci-fis would have had at least 2 of us 4 at them.
08/10/2024, 10:09 - Luke: I'm ashamed about how bad my memory is on this. Turns out there are some serious consequences of looking at your phone while watching
08/10/2024, 10:11 - Nathan: 82% of the nation can't be wrong
08/10/2024, 10:12 - John Begley: There was a whole era where we got through a lot of films and we were drinking more beer. The films were very much a secondary thing occurring in the background during this period
08/10/2024, 10:13 - John Begley: And at least one slurry session where they played a few simultaneously whilst we were on the green
08/10/2024, 10:14 - Nathan: and they were mostly played at 1.3x, making the dialogue mostly incomprehensible
08/10/2024, 10:14 - John Begley: Such efficiency
08/10/2024, 10:14 - Nathan: And this shamefully included 2001: a space odyssey I think
08/10/2024, 10:16 - John Begley: No one needs 30 minutes of monkeys hitting the floor with bones. It was a directorial failing of the original that it wasn't always at x1.3
08/10/2024, 11:29 - Luke: I was sober. Really worrying how little I remember. That excel sheet seems to be evidence that alcohol *helps* your memory
08/10/2024, 19:32 - Luke: I ended up showing my workmates this at a team lunch today. They were really struggling to understand the rule that you can only record films you have seen at sci-fi night.....They also thought we were massive geeks obvs
08/10/2024, 19:39 - John Begley: 😂
08/10/2024, 19:56 - Luke: Been looking at the list more closely. And getting a little skeptical 😁 @447846218468 when did we watch WALL-E *at* sci-fi night?
08/10/2024, 20:10 - Nathan: Yeah, I'm guessing we never did. But when else would I have watched it? And I remember the boneloss so clearly.
08/10/2024, 20:23 - Luke: 😁 I like your positive approach to remembering scifi films! Much better than my approach, of just not remembering. And realistically you have to be right, as nearly all these films have been watched! Though I'm sad to have missed out on Matrix season <This message was edited>
08/10/2024, 20:25 - John Begley: I watch sci-fi films all the time when I'm not at scifi night. It's mostly what I watch
08/10/2024, 23:06 - Nathan: Mostly
09/10/2024, 00:25 - Nathan: Fumi says Matrix season was me and her only and not at a designated sci-fi night so doesn't count. I'll retract my Matrix 1s.
09/10/2024, 09:46 - Nathan: IMDb links are in. 

John, I think you should remove your non sci-fi night watches, i.e. Ad Astra.
09/10/2024, 10:14 - John Begley: Ah, I couldn't remember when I'd seen that
09/10/2024, 10:14 - John Begley: Though historically we never had scifi film we had all seen
09/10/2024, 10:15 - Nathan: I thought you might remember the many times you vetoed it because you'd seen it already
09/10/2024, 10:16 - John Begley: Yeah. I've vetod a few in my time for this reason
09/10/2024, 10:19 - Luke: But there are no scifi films we have all seen. Because I have (almost) never watched scifi outside of scifi night
09/10/2024, 10:20 - Luke: Thanks for the correction! Feeling more confident in the data now 😁
09/10/2024, 10:31 - John Begley: Nathan, could you find the groupings you made, must be over three months ago now, so i can look at the third poster?
09/10/2024, 11:16 - Nathan: I can't find it... This is the best I've got to hand.
09/10/2024, 11:16 - Nathan: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VyCJlzk0b2uPh_n9pVmcQJF2Y40TyfrVuVWhBAfScLk/edit?usp=drivesdk
09/10/2024, 11:17 - Nathan: It's in very approximate order. You can probably work out where poster 2 ends. And seasons 5 and 6 are marked.
09/10/2024, 11:30 - Olly: admin-true
11/10/2024, 20:59 - Luke: Just saw that Threads has a rotten tomatoes score of 100%. Have we not watched it at scifi night yet because it could be too good?
11/10/2024, 21:12 - Nathan: Yeah, it's completely inappropriate
13/10/2024, 23:59 - Nathan: Sci-fi?
14/10/2024, 06:27 - John Begley: Yep
14/10/2024, 08:35 - Olly: Not today I'm afraid, have fun!
14/10/2024, 08:42 - Luke: Yeh
14/10/2024, 16:37 - Luke: What time?
14/10/2024, 16:38 - Nathan: 6
20/10/2024, 16:28 - Nathan: Sci-fi tomorrow?
20/10/2024, 16:29 - Luke: Yeh!
20/10/2024, 16:29 - John Begley: I reckon
20/10/2024, 20:23 - Olly: Alas no, hopefully next week though!

18/11/2024, 19:32 - Olly: Sorry can't make it tonight
24/11/2024, 15:35 - Olly: <Media omitted>
24/11/2024, 15:36 - Olly: Olly just re-discovered AI image generation
24/11/2024, 15:37 - Olly: Why are her legs so deep in the sand is my question for AI
25/11/2024, 09:28 - Nathan: And that's only one of the questions we could discuss at sci-fi night tonight. Anyone coming?
25/11/2024, 12:12 - John Begley: I'm in
25/11/2024, 12:23 - Luke: Sorry, can't make it tonight. A weird mix of working late and an anniversary
25/11/2024, 12:24 - Luke: Let me know the film you watch, and the quality ...and I'll think about doing my homework 😁
25/11/2024, 12:25 - Luke: Please don't watch Tank Girl (again?)
25/11/2024, 12:25 - John Begley: Or the Matrix
25/11/2024, 12:28 - Luke: Cheers! But I was already feeling like you don't have enough time for that, so I didn't need to mention it!

25/11/2024, 16:54 - John Begley: What time?
25/11/2024, 17:08 - Nathan: 6
25/11/2024, 18:31 - John Begley: My first question is what was your prompt?
25/11/2024, 20:27 - Olly: Carrie was making a presentation about different beach holidays in France and she used AI to make a picture of a dog in Disneyland in AI. So naturally I asked for a picture of a dog lady on a beach. I just loved that detail with the dog lead though

25/11/2024, 22:18 - Dodo: <Media omitted>
25/11/2024, 22:28 - Luke: 😵‍💫don't know if I'm sad I missed sci-fi, as I would know what this means, or happy I missed it....because it's quite disturbing...
26/11/2024, 09:40 - Nathan: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113135/
26/11/2024, 09:40 - Nathan: There's the homework. I think it can be considered essential viewing.

10/02/2025, 12:55 - Olly: What time it starting today? I might leave work slightly earlier, get there 6ish?
10/02/2025, 12:56 - Nathan: Cool. I'm home today so come anytime.
10/02/2025, 19:17 - Luke: Forgot to ask/ just forgot

17/02/2025, 14:01 - Olly: Not today, (or next Monday as I'm skiing) but might be around in London Thurs evening if anyone's up for a beer?
17/02/2025, 15:43 - John Begley: I can't make it today I'm afraid
20/02/2025, 20:00 - Olly: Any interest in sci-caravan-fi on early May bank holiday weekend 3-5 May?

Wife is away, we have a mobile home just outside Poole, Dorset is nice and sci fi exists.
20/02/2025, 20:09 - Olly: ... And two free single beds in one room, a big fold-out sofa bed, and a sitting room with way more floor space than the downstairs of my house
21/02/2025, 00:36 - Nathan: Sounds great. I'm in.
21/02/2025, 08:39 - Luke: Yeh, this sounds great 👌thanks for offering! I would definitely be up for it
21/02/2025, 08:47 - Olly: Awesome! I will have a car and so can pick people up from train stations and drive us to hike-fi destinations, crucial as that will be the only time spent on the weekend away from sci fi films
21/02/2025, 16:39 - John Begley: I am in also
21/02/2025, 16:43 - John Begley: Love the hike-fi name. It's such good branding
21/02/2025, 16:58 - Olly: Excellent! My sci fi film watching stats have been taking a hit, so it's great that I'll be able to finally sci fi it up!
21/02/2025, 17:02 - Olly: Btw I can probably give people lifts too, can organise nearer the time
21/02/2025, 17:05 - Olly: Fri evening-Sun or Sat-Mon, or other?
21/02/2025, 17:16 - John Begley: Flexible with all dates as I have Fridays off anyway
21/02/2025, 17:27 - Luke: I have Friday afternoons off, so also flexible!
21/02/2025, 20:02 - Nathan: Cong cong cong awkward awkward awkward
21/02/2025, 21:30 - Olly: Ginsenopsis, Brain, Deafness
24/02/2025, 08:07 - Nathan: Sci-fi?
24/02/2025, 08:07 - John Begley: Yes please
24/02/2025, 08:08 - Luke: Yes🫡
24/02/2025, 15:33 - Luke: What time?
24/02/2025, 15:34 - Nathan: Any time at all
24/02/2025, 16:03 - Luke: Between 5-5.30
24/02/2025, 16:03 - John Begley: 6
24/02/2025, 21:57 - John Begley: <Media omitted>

02/03/2025, 14:56 - Nathan: Bi-fi night. Gareth Thomas's band supporting.

Anyone wanna go? Get your own ticket!
02/03/2025, 20:56 - Nathan: Sci-fi tomorrow?
02/03/2025, 22:43 - Luke: Yeh!
02/03/2025, 22:43 - Luke: Is this the final one at Camberwell Church st? 😢
02/03/2025, 23:05 - Nathan: It might be. Not sure yet
03/03/2025, 15:51 - Nathan: Half 6 start tonight
03/03/2025, 15:53 - John Begley: I can't make it I'm afraid
03/03/2025, 15:55 - Nathan: I think the last one is going to be next Monday. 

Then a goodbye party on the 22nd.
03/03/2025, 15:57 - Luke: Food vote by whatsapp?
03/03/2025, 16:28 - Nathan: Sure
03/03/2025, 16:28 - John Begley: Bolu
03/03/2025, 16:48 - Olly: You are having an actual party on sat 22nd march?
03/03/2025, 16:48 - John Begley: The cupboard smashing party I assume
03/03/2025, 16:49 - Olly: I like the sound of that. Bring hammers? I've got a wrecking bar too
03/03/2025, 16:50 - Olly: "Wrecking bar" would be a good name for a distopian sci fi pub
05/03/2025, 12:33 - Nathan: Yes. Actual party on Saturday 22nd March to say goodbye to 21 Camberwell Church Street after almost 14 years for me and 7 for Fumi. Come any time from 3 pm till late. All welcome. Fumi will be doing some food but we can still vote on stuff.

No need to bring destructive tools, the landlord still has the deposit.
08/03/2025, 23:50 - Olly: I just watched "the substance". Quite amazing, very horrible. Mainly body horror, but definitely technically sci fi
09/03/2025, 23:14 - Nathan: You deleted this message
09/03/2025, 23:20 - Nathan: You know you're not supposed to watch sci-fi outside of sci-fi night?
09/03/2025, 23:24 - Olly: Yes. I thought it was pure horror and realised too late! Definitely needs to be condensed down a lot to get to the canonical 90 minutes. Or maybe just skip straight to the last 15 minutes
09/03/2025, 23:34 - Nathan: Maybe you could make a sci-fi night edit for us?
09/03/2025, 23:34 - Nathan: Last sci-fi night for a little while tomorrow.
10/03/2025, 06:10 - John Begley: I'm not able to come I'm afraid. I'd like for there to be an effigy of some sort displayed. And it should be included in the voting.
10/03/2025, 07:09 - Luke: Yeh
10/03/2025, 18:29 - Nathan: <Media omitted>
10/03/2025, 18:38 - Nathan: <Media omitted>
10/03/2025, 19:16 - John Begley: Bolu
10/03/2025, 19:19 - John Begley: The body on this is very good
10/03/2025, 20:36 - Nathan: <Media omitted>
10/03/2025, 22:16 - Luke: If you haven't started already...maybe don't?
11/03/2025, 08:02 - John Begley: Out of ten?
11/03/2025, 08:32 - Luke: 3
11/03/2025, 08:32 - John Begley: Sounds like a sci-fi night classic!
11/03/2025, 08:32 - Luke: And that 3 is because despite the dreadful plot, dialogue and acting, they picked great filming locations
11/03/2025, 08:33 - Luke: Haha, yeh was a fitting film for potentially the last scifi night at church street <This message was edited>
11/03/2025, 09:16 - Nathan: Don't forget the planes and balloons
11/03/2025, 09:18 - Luke: Opinion was divided on the planes
11/03/2025, 09:34 - Nathan: But we all loved the balloons
11/03/2025, 09:37 - John Begley: Haha, it sounds great
11/03/2025, 11:34 - Olly: All sounds sensible, but did you consider: Sound Difficult to pronounce acoustic hearing hearing sound difficult to pronounce the sound towering difficult to pronounce together in conjunction.
11/03/2025, 13:51 - John Begley: It's basically all I consider
17/03/2025, 00:32 - Nathan: Surprise sci-fi tonight?
17/03/2025, 05:11 - John Begley: Yes!
17/03/2025, 05:58 - Luke: 👍
17/03/2025, 14:29 - Luke: What time?
17/03/2025, 14:29 - Nathan: 6
19/03/2025, 12:42 - Luke: As we won't have a scifi night venue for the next week or two 😢, should we go watch Mickey 17 at Peckhamplex?

https://www.peckhamplex.london/film/mickey-17
19/03/2025, 12:43 - John Begley: I'm in, in theory
19/03/2025, 12:43 - John Begley: Actually just realized next Monday I'm definitely out
19/03/2025, 12:45 - Luke: Monday after? Or even....not a Monday?
19/03/2025, 12:46 - Nathan: Whoaaaa
21/03/2025, 13:39 - Nathan: Cheeky sci-fi anyone?
21/03/2025, 13:43 - Luke: Right now?
21/03/2025, 13:43 - Luke: Ok
21/03/2025, 13:58 - John Begley: I'm in
29/03/2025, 11:37 - Olly: Carrie had some fun experimenting with some serious AI programming, creating a full website for setting up book clubs (originally for managing her book club) writing almost no lines of code. If you changed the pics and replace 'book' with 'film' you'd have a film club website too. It is too sensible and user friendly for sci fi of course, but thought I'd show case it anyway as it's pretty for for normal-film-club purpose <This message was edited>
29/03/2025, 11:37 - Olly: https://bookclub.wiselapwing.co.uk/register?group_id=c881595e-29b9-45fe-b7bc-5e0ed64981d8
29/03/2025, 11:38 - Olly: If you are interested in the power of vibes based coding, register at the above link and you can enter her 'test' book club group, add imaginary books, schedule imaginary meetings and vote on books and meetings <This message was edited>
31/03/2025, 09:02 - Nathan: Amazing stuff. Sorry I missed the meeting on 100 years of solitude.
31/03/2025, 09:34 - Nathan: Does anyone fancy a trip to the cinema to see Mickey 17 this week? 

I'm free every evening except Wednesday.
31/03/2025, 12:39 - Olly: I'll be in the office in London tomorrow, so could meet up after!
31/03/2025, 13:52 - Luke: I'm not free Wednesday or friday
31/03/2025, 18:25 - Nathan: Shall we do tomorrow then?
31/03/2025, 19:12 - Olly: What time is it where?
31/03/2025, 19:27 - Nathan: How about the 20:15 showing at the Barbican?
31/03/2025, 22:00 - Olly: It's going to be a late one, but yes I'm in
31/03/2025, 22:00 - John Begley: Sorry. I'm not about. Have a good one though
31/03/2025, 22:51 - Luke: Yeh I'm up for it. But are there no earlier ones, that are also well located for Oli?
31/03/2025, 22:53 - Nathan: I don't know, but happy with anything, really. Olly?
31/03/2025, 23:49 - Nathan: Odeon Leicester Square has a 19:30. Odeon Haymarket, 17:50. Both a bit pricey though.
01/04/2025, 08:02 - Olly: Original plan sound good if that works, else Leicester sq if Luke prefers?
01/04/2025, 08:20 - Luke: Cool. I'm pro original plan. Better bike lanes to Barbican 👌
01/04/2025, 10:10 - Nathan: Ok. Barbican it is! I'll book tickets. Shall we eat first?
01/04/2025, 10:19 - Olly: Yes! I can get somewhere central by approx 530 I expect. Thanks for booking
01/04/2025, 10:58 - Nathan: My humble opinion on the food options available around Barbican. I honestly think going to a pub around is the best option:



Korean bbq (4min - reservation available)
https://maps.app.goo.gl/AtTDXmjgD9U1TfB88?g_st=com.google.maps.preview.copy

Oficina 00 (10min - reservation available)
Handmade pasta, I’ve always wanted to try but a bit pricey (ragú pappardelle £17)
https://maps.app.goo.gl/mVFiPtPXs9BfebT57?g_st=com.google.maps.preview.copy

Monohon Ramen (9min - no res)
Good authentic Japanese ramen (we’ve been)
https://maps.app.goo.gl/mVFiPtPXs9BfebT57?g_st=com.google.maps.preview.copy

The Sichuan restaurant (10min)
We’ve been with Paul and Claire when Christian couldn’t make it.
https://maps.app.goo.gl/iDNnw92auamezr796?g_st=com.google.maps.preview.copy

Relais de venise 
One menu (entrecôte and chips around 30£) restaurant which I’ve been meaning to go with you. No reservation, likely queue, 13min
https://maps.app.goo.gl/BnMQVqLJii7t43mR8?g_st=com.google.maps.preview.copy
01/04/2025, 10:59 - Nathan: Let's food vote! Thanks to Fumi for the list.
01/04/2025, 11:30 - Olly: Good list, confused though you said pub is best but no pubs in list?
01/04/2025, 11:31 - Dodo: It’s because I’m not capable of judging what a good pub is 😌
01/04/2025, 11:32 - Dodo: But consider pub(general) on the list!
01/04/2025, 11:37 - Nathan: Think I'm gonna vote KBBQ. Mainly for the KFC and proximity though.
01/04/2025, 12:08 - Luke: Hey guys, I've got food that needs to be eaten, and I need to cook for Izzy. So I was going to eat first and then hopefully meet up with you at about 6.30. so don't include me in the food vote
01/04/2025, 12:09 - Luke: Though.... if you happen to be having some Korean fried chicken anyway, I could probably manage a piece or two 😏
01/04/2025, 14:58 - Olly: I love Korean frieds chicken. In
01/04/2025, 14:59 - Olly: I'm in
01/04/2025, 16:22 - Nathan: Great!
01/04/2025, 16:35 - Nathan: https://maps.app.goo.gl/wGhLcLtgdL5iF6CLA?g_st=aw
01/04/2025, 16:38 - Nathan: Let's meet at this lovely pub before. Restaurant booked for half 6.
01/04/2025, 16:41 - Olly: Cheers!
01/04/2025, 16:43 - Olly: Cool see you there 530ish
01/04/2025, 17:33 - Nathan: Got a table at the front
07/04/2025, 10:45 - Nathan: Sci-fi tonight?
07/04/2025, 14:18 - Luke: Sorry! Can't tonight. but definitely should be able to in the next weeks
07/04/2025, 17:59 - Olly: Sorry early morning tomorrow, can't make tonight!
07/04/2025, 18:04 - John Begley: Hey, sorry I also can't make it
07/04/2025, 18:10 - Nathan: I'll get to work on the slurry
13/04/2025, 21:41 - Nathan: Sci-fi tomorrow?
13/04/2025, 21:49 - Luke: Yeh!
13/04/2025, 21:53 - Olly: Probably not, but hopefully next time!
14/04/2025, 06:22 - John Begley: Maybe but I will have to say later
14/04/2025, 14:09 - Luke: What time?
14/04/2025, 14:11 - Nathan: Any time!
14/04/2025, 14:12 - Luke: Cool! Prob about 5.30
14/04/2025, 17:39 - Luke: How do I get in?
14/04/2025, 17:39 - Nathan: Buzz flat 8
14/04/2025, 17:40 - John Begley: I will be there 6:30ish
14/04/2025, 17:41 - Luke: Bike parking is looking awkward. I'm gonna park at home then walk back. I'll be like 5-10 mins
14/04/2025, 17:42 - Nathan: Ok. I lock mine to a lamppost on the street
14/04/2025, 17:48 - Luke: I saw! Hard to do with a d-lock
14/04/2025, 18:18 - John Begley: I am outside. How does it mean?
14/04/2025, 18:19 - John Begley: What's the number?
14/04/2025, 18:20 - John Begley: Saw it
29/04/2025, 08:54 - Olly: Caravaners, I'm planning on departing St Albans 3pm on Friday. I've remembered that a dog will be taking up half the back seat (but she has her little house in there so won't be on top of anyone in the back), but I can take one person in front and one in back. I have a big boot for bags. Any dog allergy sufferers might want to go with John though
29/04/2025, 08:55 - Olly: No one is so badly dog allergic or dog-disliking that Elsas presence in caravan is an issue I hope? I kind of forgot about her <This message was edited>
29/04/2025, 09:00 - Olly: I'm driving m25-m3, so any train station near M3 works. Eg Virginia water, Farnborough, Basingstoke etc
29/04/2025, 09:01 - Nathan: I think I'll probably get the train. Got a meeting at 4.
29/04/2025, 09:02 - Olly: I can leave later if that's a general consensus - paradoxically the traffic is often better on Friday around 5pm
29/04/2025, 09:04 - Olly: Luke, are you ok with dogs? I'll feel terrible if I didn't disclose this detail and it turns out to be important. No judgement from me either way
29/04/2025, 09:10 - Luke: I like dogs! No worries
29/04/2025, 09:11 - Nathan: I could get to Virginia Water by half 6. But equally, could just take the train to Poole.
29/04/2025, 09:17 - Olly: Phew!
29/04/2025, 13:22 - Luke: Oof. In-person meetings at 4pm on a Friday 😩
29/04/2025, 13:25 - Olly: I'm happy to drive down and pick you both up at 630, or can pick Luke up earlier if you prefer. I don't know what time John prefers
30/04/2025, 07:15 - Luke: I'm flexible, so up for 6.30 at Virginia water 👍
30/04/2025, 07:31 - John Begley: No sure. I will have the afternoon off and can probably leave around 12ish if anyone wants to get there early etc. I could do a shop for some food and beer etc if people create a list?
30/04/2025, 08:23 - Luke: Oooo, I would probably be up for leaving earlier, helping out with the shop, and enjoying the sunny afternoon 😎

do you know what time and place would be good for me to get to for pickup?
30/04/2025, 08:24 - Luke: I can get a Santander bike to Waterloo, London bridge or vauxhall in like 15 mins, and then get a train to a convenient station 🤷‍♂️
30/04/2025, 09:09 - John Begley: Let me check this evening and get back to you but that all feels very doable
30/04/2025, 10:10 - Olly: List of things to pack/not pack: (1) [not sure if we'll use it, but] bring swim wear. (2) Bring shoes to walk on cliffs and beeches. (3) Don't need to bring any bedding (4) Nathan bring sci fi films laptop and long hdmi (or I can bring my hdmi if more convenient). (5) Do bring a towel. (6) Two lucky people will be in single beds in same room, so bring ear plugs/ ear phones if you are worried about snoring
30/04/2025, 10:11 - John Begley: Feels like we have a high stakes game of 'lowest non-repetitive number' brewing...
30/04/2025, 11:04 - Nathan: Really gonna put Luke's dedication to "1" to the test
30/04/2025, 11:04 - Nathan: I'll bring my HDMI cable, but bring yours too. Mine didn't work in Sauze.
30/04/2025, 11:05 - Nathan: And Olly, don't it's only me now, if you wanna leave early on Friday, it's fine. I'll get the train.
30/04/2025, 11:12 - Luke: I see it more as putting your dedication to "1" to the test 😁
30/04/2025, 23:13 - Olly: Ok I'll leave 4ish, and then I can pick you up from the station Nathan
30/04/2025, 23:14 - Olly: https://goo.gl/maps/KMaKaJK5aMp9c4ac6?g_st=aw
30/04/2025, 23:19 - Olly: That is the exact position of the caravan, John. You don't need to check in or stop at the park entrance, just drive straight through to the pin. The pitch is 9A Harbour view, also with sign 'woodlark'. You park to the left (whilst facing the caravan, ie park on side with entrance door) <This message was edited>
30/04/2025, 23:20 - Olly: Will update you with keybox code
01/05/2025, 07:58 - John Begley: I reckon Canning Town, Barking or westham are best for me. But if there is a south London station around the m25 area that is easy to get to, let me know
01/05/2025, 08:00 - Nathan: Poole station?
01/05/2025, 08:02 - Olly: Poole or hamworthy
01/05/2025, 08:03 - John Begley: I thought you were suggesting the station I meet Luke at 🤣
01/05/2025, 08:06 - Nathan: lol
01/05/2025, 08:07 - Nathan: I'm due in to Hamworthy at 2039.
01/05/2025, 08:50 - Luke: How does Leatherhead look? Station looks close to a M25 junction that I *think* is on your way...but I don't know driving, so let me know if not really convenient
01/05/2025, 08:55 - John Begley: Looks good let's aim for there then
01/05/2025, 08:57 - Luke: Perfect as easy from vauxhall. What time do you want me there?
01/05/2025, 08:58 - John Begley: It looks like it will take about an hour and half for me to get there. Could meet you there at three?
01/05/2025, 09:03 - Nathan: Any unwatched films on the list anyone actually wants to watch?
01/05/2025, 13:46 - Olly: No idea!
01/05/2025, 13:50 - Olly: See you guys tomorrow! To get in for John and Luke: see pin and instructions above. Make yourself at home.

 There are 2 lock boxes near the gate onto the veranda. Code is 1325 on digital box, and if that doesn't work it's 1365 on analog box.

I'll probably arrive tomorrow at 7pm-ish
01/05/2025, 22:11 - Luke: Robocop 3, the kitchen, tank girl (again), back to the futures
01/05/2025, 22:12 - Luke: Tbh I just had a look through the unwatched list, and was kind of surprised how watchable most of them sounded. Really want expecting it
01/05/2025, 22:32 - Nathan: Cool. I'll add them.
01/05/2025, 23:21 - Luke: Quite like the look of Punishment Park too
01/05/2025, 23:21 - Olly: Congwengkuilian?
01/05/2025, 23:23 - Nathan: Embryos, stomach, palpitations
02/05/2025, 16:27 - Olly: On the road, ETA 730
02/05/2025, 16:27 - Olly: We can get some frozen pizzas or something for dinner?
02/05/2025, 17:26 - Luke: Me and John were thinking fish and chips....others up for it? And Oli, any good recommendations?
02/05/2025, 18:05 - Luke: We have got you a frozen pizza as we are going to try and eat beforehand
02/05/2025, 18:11 - John Begley: <Media omitted>
02/05/2025, 18:37 - Nathan: Haha. Is that what we're drinking?
02/05/2025, 18:38 - Nathan: My train left on time.
02/05/2025, 20:37 - Nathan: Just pulling into Poole. Next stop Hamworthy.
02/05/2025, 20:38 - Olly: I'll be there in 3 minutes.
04/05/2025, 11:31 - Nathan: Jim Halo Polarized Sunglasses for Men Women Wrap Around Sprot Sun Glasses for Cycling Fishing Driving

04/05/2025, 23:16 - Olly: Now we know what one legged fashionable dog walker Nathan looks like

08/05/2025, 14:21 - Nathan: Very very funny
08/05/2025, 14:23 - Olly: I really wish we did have an extra mini -Luke on the trip. But now he's been immortalised in this photograph mini-Luke is as real as anything else that happened last weekend
08/05/2025, 14:32 - Luke: This is truly great
08/05/2025, 14:33 - Luke: Though mini-me looks likes a bit of a dick 🤷‍♂️
08/05/2025, 14:34 - Luke: And despite all the inaccuracies of AI, my big forehead is perfectly accurate...on both of me
08/05/2025, 14:36 - John Begley: Hahahahahaha
08/05/2025, 22:31 - Olly: I just laughed hysterically again. Let's just give it a little more deserving attention:
08/05/2025, 22:31 - Olly: <Media omitted>

11/05/2025, 13:55 - Luke: Any chance sci-fi is happening tomorrow?
11/05/2025, 13:56 - Nathan: Yeah, really high chance
12/05/2025, 08:52 - Olly: If mini-Luke is going, you can count me out
12/05/2025, 08:52 - Olly: (and also if he isn't going I can't make it, as it happens)
12/05/2025, 10:01 - Nathan: Is big Luke coming? Anyone else?
12/05/2025, 10:12 - John Begley: Is it ok if I am a bit undecided until later?
12/05/2025, 10:12 - John Begley: I am vey tired, but also would like to come. But I don't finish until half 5 so it makes it a late one
12/05/2025, 10:13 - Nathan: Ok. Sure. You're welcome to stay.
12/05/2025, 11:01 - Luke: A Luke is guaranteed. But the exact Luke that shows can be voted on.
12/05/2025, 14:00 - Luke: What time you thinking of starting?
12/05/2025, 14:04 - Nathan: Starting the which Luke vote?
12/05/2025, 14:04 - Nathan: Now. Mini.
12/05/2025, 14:40 - Luke: Forgot the mention, both Luke's get a vote. So the rest of you will have to be unanimous to swing it
12/05/2025, 15:27 - John Begley: He, I can't make it tonight. I have to get up vey early tomorrow. Sorry
12/05/2025, 16:21 - Nathan: Half 5.
